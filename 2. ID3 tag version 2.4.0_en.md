Abstract

       This document describes the main structure of ID3v2.4.0, which is a
       revised version of the ID3v2 informal standard [ID3v2] version
       2.3.0. The ID3v2 offers a flexible way of storing audio meta
       information within the audio file itself. The information may be
       technical information, such as equalisation curves, as well as
       title, performer, copyright etc.

       ID3v2.4.0 is meant to be as close as possible to ID3v2.3.0 in order
       to allow for implementations to be revised as easily as possible.

2.   Conventions in this document

   Text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a tag.
   Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers preceded with %
   are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x
   is used to indicate a bit with unknown content. The most significant
   bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit
   (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.

   A tag is the whole tag described in this document. A frame is a block
   of information in the tag. The tag consists of a header, frames and
   optional padding. A field is a piece of information; one value, a
   string etc. A numeric string is a string that consists of the
   characters "0123456789" only.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


3.   ID3v2 overview

   ID3v2 is a general tagging format for audio, which makes it possible
   to store meta data about the audio inside the audio file itself. The
   ID3 tag described in this document is mainly targeted at files
   encoded with MPEG-1/2 layer I, MPEG-1/2 layer II, MPEG-1/2 layer III
   and MPEG-2.5, but may work with other types of encoded audio or as a
   stand alone format for audio meta data.

   ID3v2 is designed to be as flexible and expandable as possible to
   meet new meta information needs that might arise. To achieve that
   ID3v2 is constructed as a container for several information blocks,
   called frames, whose format need not be known to the software that
   encounters them. At the start of every frame is an unique and
   predefined identifier, a size descriptor that allows software to skip
   unknown frames and a flags field. The flags describes encoding
   details and if the frame should remain in the tag, should it be
   unknown to the software, if the file is altered.

   The bitorder in ID3v2 is most significant bit first (MSB). The
   byteorder in multibyte numbers is most significant byte first (e.g.
   $12345678 would be encoded $12 34 56 78), also known as big endian
   and network byte order.

   Overall tag structure:

     +-----------------------------+
     |      Header (10 bytes)      |
     +-----------------------------+
     |       Extended Header       |
     | (variable length, OPTIONAL) |
     +-----------------------------+
     |   Frames (variable length)  |
     +-----------------------------+
     |           Padding           |
     | (variable length, OPTIONAL) |
     +-----------------------------+
     | Footer (10 bytes, OPTIONAL) |
     +-----------------------------+

   In general, padding and footer are mutually exclusive. See details in
   sections 3.3, 3.4 and 5.


3.1.   ID3v2 header

   The first part of the ID3v2 tag is the 10 byte tag header, laid out
   as follows:

     ID3v2/file identifier      "ID3"
     ID3v2 version              $04 00
     ID3v2 flags                %abcd0000
     ID3v2 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx

   The first three bytes of the tag are always "ID3", to indicate that
   this is an ID3v2 tag, directly followed by the two version bytes. The
   first byte of ID3v2 version is its major version, while the second
   byte is its revision number. In this case this is ID3v2.4.0. All
   revisions are backwards compatible while major versions are not. If
   software with ID3v2.4.0 and below support should encounter version
   five or higher it should simply ignore the whole tag. Version or
   revision will never be $FF.

   The version is followed by the ID3v2 flags field, of which currently
   four flags are used.


   a - Unsynchronisation

     Bit 7 in the 'ID3v2 flags' indicates whether or not
     unsynchronisation is applied on all frames (see section 6.1 for
     details); a set bit indicates usage.


   b - Extended header

     The second bit (bit 6) indicates whether or not the header is
     followed by an extended header. The extended header is described in
     section 3.2. A set bit indicates the presence of an extended
     header.


   c - Experimental indicator

     The third bit (bit 5) is used as an 'experimental indicator'. This
     flag SHALL always be set when the tag is in an experimental stage.


   d - Footer present

     Bit 4 indicates that a footer (section 3.4) is present at the very
     end of the tag. A set bit indicates the presence of a footer.


   All the other flags MUST be cleared. If one of these undefined flags
   are set, the tag might not be readable for a parser that does not
   know the flags function.

   The ID3v2 tag size is stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer (section
   6.2), making a total of 28 effective bits (representing up to 256MB).

   The ID3v2 tag size is the sum of the byte length of the extended
   header, the padding and the frames after unsynchronisation. If a
   footer is present this equals to ('total size' - 20) bytes, otherwise
   ('total size' - 10) bytes.

   An ID3v2 tag can be detected with the following pattern:
     $49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
   Where yy is less than $FF, xx is the 'flags' byte and zz is less than
   $80.


3.2. Extended header

   The extended header contains information that can provide further
   insight in the structure of the tag, but is not vital to the correct
   parsing of the tag information; hence the extended header is
   optional.

     Extended header size   4 * %0xxxxxxx
     Number of flag bytes       $01
     Extended Flags             $xx

   Where the 'Extended header size' is the size of the whole extended
   header, stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer. An extended header can
   thus never have a size of fewer than six bytes.

   The extended flags field, with its size described by 'number of flag
   bytes', is defined as:

     %0bcd0000

   Each flag that is set in the extended header has data attached, which
   comes in the order in which the flags are encountered (i.e. the data
   for flag 'b' comes before the data for flag 'c'). Unset flags cannot
   have any attached data. All unknown flags MUST be unset and their
   corresponding data removed when a tag is modified.

   Every set flag's data starts with a length byte, which contains a
   value between 0 and 128 ($00 - $7f), followed by data that has the
   field length indicated by the length byte. If a flag has no attached
   data, the value $00 is used as length byte.


   b - Tag is an update

     If this flag is set, the present tag is an update of a tag found
     earlier in the present file or stream. If frames defined as unique
     are found in the present tag, they are to override any
     corresponding ones found in the earlier tag. This flag has no
     corresponding data.

         Flag data length      $00

   c - CRC data present

     If this flag is set, a CRC-32 [ISO-3309] data is included in the
     extended header. The CRC is calculated on all the data between the
     header and footer as indicated by the header's tag length field,
     minus the extended header. Note that this includes the padding (if
     there is any), but excludes the footer. The CRC-32 is stored as an
     35 bit synchsafe integer, leaving the upper four bits always
     zeroed.

        Flag data length       $05
        Total frame CRC    5 * %0xxxxxxx

   d - Tag restrictions

     For some applications it might be desired to restrict a tag in more
     ways than imposed by the ID3v2 specification. Note that the
     presence of these restrictions does not affect how the tag is
     decoded, merely how it was restricted before encoding. If this flag
     is set the tag is restricted as follows:

        Flag data length       $01
        Restrictions           %ppqrrstt

     p - Tag size restrictions

       00   No more than 128 frames and 1 MB total tag size.
       01   No more than 64 frames and 128 KB total tag size.
       10   No more than 32 frames and 40 KB total tag size.
       11   No more than 32 frames and 4 KB total tag size.

     q - Text encoding restrictions

       0    No restrictions
       1    Strings are only encoded with ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1] or
            UTF-8 [UTF-8].

     r - Text fields size restrictions

       00   No restrictions
       01   No string is longer than 1024 characters.
       10   No string is longer than 128 characters.
       11   No string is longer than 30 characters.

       Note that nothing is said about how many bytes is used to
       represent those characters, since it is encoding dependent. If a
       text frame consists of more than one string, the sum of the
       strungs is restricted as stated.

     s - Image encoding restrictions

       0   No restrictions
       1   Images are encoded only with PNG [PNG] or JPEG [JFIF].

     t - Image size restrictions

       00  No restrictions
       01  All images are 256x256 pixels or smaller.
       10  All images are 64x64 pixels or smaller.
       11  All images are exactly 64x64 pixels, unless required
           otherwise.


3.3.   Padding

   It is OPTIONAL to include padding after the final frame (at the end
   of the ID3 tag), making the size of all the frames together smaller
   than the size given in the tag header. A possible purpose of this
   padding is to allow for adding a few additional frames or enlarge
   existing frames within the tag without having to rewrite the entire
   file. The value of the padding bytes must be $00. A tag MUST NOT have
   any padding between the frames or between the tag header and the
   frames. Furthermore it MUST NOT have any padding when a tag footer is
   added to the tag.


3.4.   ID3v2 footer

   To speed up the process of locating an ID3v2 tag when searching from
   the end of a file, a footer can be added to the tag. It is REQUIRED
   to add a footer to an appended tag, i.e. a tag located after all
   audio data. The footer is a copy of the header, but with a different
   identifier.

     ID3v2 identifier           "3DI"
     ID3v2 version              $04 00
     ID3v2 flags                %abcd0000
     ID3v2 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx


4.   ID3v2 frame overview

   All ID3v2 frames consists of one frame header followed by one or more
   fields containing the actual information. The header is always 10
   bytes and laid out as follows:

     Frame ID      $xx xx xx xx  (four characters)
     Size      4 * %0xxxxxxx
     Flags         $xx xx

   The frame ID is made out of the characters capital A-Z and 0-9.
   Identifiers beginning with "X", "Y" and "Z" are for experimental
   frames and free for everyone to use, without the need to set the
   experimental bit in the tag header. Bear in mind that someone else
   might have used the same identifier as you. All other identifiers are
   either used or reserved for future use.

   The frame ID is followed by a size descriptor containing the size of
   the data in the final frame, after encryption, compression and
   unsynchronisation. The size is excluding the frame header ('total
   frame size' - 10 bytes) and stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer.

   In the frame header the size descriptor is followed by two flag
   bytes. These flags are described in section 4.1.

   There is no fixed order of the frames' appearance in the tag,
   although it is desired that the frames are arranged in order of
   significance concerning the recognition of the file. An example of
   such order: UFID, TIT2, MCDI, TRCK ...

   A tag MUST contain at least one frame. A frame must be at least 1
   byte big, excluding the header.

   If nothing else is said, strings, including numeric strings and URLs
   [URL], are represented as ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1] characters in the
   range $20 - $FF. Such strings are represented in frame descriptions
   as <text string>, or <full text string> if newlines are allowed. If
   nothing else is said newline character is forbidden. In ISO-8859-1 a
   newline is represented, when allowed, with $0A only.

   Frames that allow different types of text encoding contains a text
   encoding description byte. Possible encodings:

     $00   ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. Terminated with $00.
     $01   UTF-16 [UTF-16] encoded Unicode [UNICODE] with BOM. All
           strings in the same frame SHALL have the same byteorder.
           Terminated with $00 00.
     $02   UTF-16BE [UTF-16] encoded Unicode [UNICODE] without BOM.
           Terminated with $00 00.
     $03   UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoded Unicode [UNICODE]. Terminated with $00.

   Strings dependent on encoding are represented in frame descriptions
   as <text string according to encoding>, or <full text string
   according to encoding> if newlines are allowed. Any empty strings of
   type $01 which are NULL-terminated may have the Unicode BOM followed
   by a Unicode NULL ($FF FE 00 00 or $FE FF 00 00).

   The timestamp fields are based on a subset of ISO 8601. When being as
   precise as possible the format of a time string is
   yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss (year, "-", month, "-", day, "T", hour (out of
   24), ":", minutes, ":", seconds), but the precision may be reduced by
   removing as many time indicators as wanted. Hence valid timestamps
   are
   yyyy, yyyy-MM, yyyy-MM-dd, yyyy-MM-ddTHH, yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm and
   yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss. All time stamps are UTC. For durations, use
   the slash character as described in 8601, and for multiple non-
   contiguous dates, use multiple strings, if allowed by the frame
   definition.

   The three byte language field, present in several frames, is used to
   describe the language of the frame's content, according to ISO-639-2
   [ISO-639-2]. The language should be represented in lower case. If the
   language is not known the string "XXX" should be used.

   All URLs [URL] MAY be relative, e.g. "picture.png", "../doc.txt".

   If a frame is longer than it should be, e.g. having more fields than
   specified in this document, that indicates that additions to the
   frame have been made in a later version of the ID3v2 standard. This
   is reflected by the revision number in the header of the tag.


4.1.   Frame header flags

   In the frame header the size descriptor is followed by two flag
   bytes. All unused flags MUST be cleared. The first byte is for
   'status messages' and the second byte is a format description. If an
   unknown flag is set in the first byte the frame MUST NOT be changed
   without that bit cleared. If an unknown flag is set in the second
   byte the frame is likely to not be readable. Some flags in the second
   byte indicates that extra information is added to the header. These
   fields of extra information is ordered as the flags that indicates
   them. The flags field is defined as follows (l and o left out because
   ther resemblence to one and zero):

     %0abc0000 %0h00kmnp

   Some frame format flags indicate that additional information fields
   are added to the frame. This information is added after the frame
   header and before the frame data in the same order as the flags that
   indicates them. I.e. the four bytes of decompressed size will precede
   the encryption method byte. These additions affects the 'frame size'
   field, but are not subject to encryption or compression.
   
   The default status flags setting for a frame is, unless stated
   otherwise, 'preserved if tag is altered' and 'preserved if file is
   altered', i.e. %00000000.


4.1.1. Frame status flags

   a - Tag alter preservation

     This flag tells the tag parser what to do with this frame if it is
     unknown and the tag is altered in any way. This applies to all
     kinds of alterations, including adding more padding and reordering
     the frames.

     0     Frame should be preserved.
     1     Frame should be discarded.


   b - File alter preservation

     This flag tells the tag parser what to do with this frame if it is
     unknown and the file, excluding the tag, is altered. This does not
     apply when the audio is completely replaced with other audio data.

     0     Frame should be preserved.
     1     Frame should be discarded.


   c - Read only

      This flag, if set, tells the software that the contents of this
      frame are intended to be read only. Changing the contents might
      break something, e.g. a signature. If the contents are changed,
      without knowledge of why the frame was flagged read only and
      without taking the proper means to compensate, e.g. recalculating
      the signature, the bit MUST be cleared.


4.1.2. Frame format flags

   h - Grouping identity

      This flag indicates whether or not this frame belongs in a group
      with other frames. If set, a group identifier byte is added to the
      frame. Every frame with the same group identifier belongs to the
      same group.

      0     Frame does not contain group information
      1     Frame contains group information


   k - Compression

      This flag indicates whether or not the frame is compressed.
      A 'Data Length Indicator' byte MUST be included in the frame.

      0     Frame is not compressed.
      1     Frame is compressed using zlib [zlib] deflate method.
            If set, this requires the 'Data Length Indicator' bit
            to be set as well.


   m - Encryption
   
      This flag indicates whether or not the frame is encrypted. If set,
      one byte indicating with which method it was encrypted will be
      added to the frame. See description of the ENCR frame for more
      information about encryption method registration. Encryption
      should be done after compression. Whether or not setting this flag
      requires the presence of a 'Data Length Indicator' depends on the
      specific algorithm used.

      0     Frame is not encrypted.
      1     Frame is encrypted.

   n - Unsynchronisation

      This flag indicates whether or not unsynchronisation was applied
      to this frame. See section 6 for details on unsynchronisation.
      If this flag is set all data from the end of this header to the
      end of this frame has been unsynchronised. Although desirable, the
      presence of a 'Data Length Indicator' is not made mandatory by
      unsynchronisation.

      0     Frame has not been unsynchronised.
      1     Frame has been unsyrchronised.

   p - Data length indicator

      This flag indicates that a data length indicator has been added to
      the frame. The data length indicator is the value one would write
      as the 'Frame length' if all of the frame format flags were
      zeroed, represented as a 32 bit synchsafe integer.

      0      There is no Data Length Indicator.
      1      A data length Indicator has been added to the frame.


5.   Tag location

   The default location of an ID3v2 tag is prepended to the audio so
   that players can benefit from the information when the data is
   streamed. It is however possible to append the tag, or make a
   prepend/append combination. When deciding upon where an unembedded
   tag should be located, the following order of preference SHOULD be
   considered.
   
     1. Prepend the tag.

     2. Prepend a tag with all vital information and add a second tag at 
        the end of the file, before tags from other tagging systems. The
        first tag is required to have a SEEK frame.
      
     3. Add a tag at the end of the file, before tags from other tagging
        systems.
      
   In case 2 and 3 the tag can simply be appended if no other known tags
   are present. The suggested method to find ID3v2 tags are:
   
     1. Look for a prepended tag using the pattern found in section 3.1.

     2. If a SEEK frame was found, use its values to guide further
        searching.

     3. Look for a tag footer, scanning from the back of the file.

   For every new tag that is found, the old tag should be discarded
   unless the update flag in the extended header (section 3.2) is set.
   

6.   Unsynchronisation

   The only purpose of unsynchronisation is to make the ID3v2 tag as
   compatible as possible with existing software and hardware. There is
   no use in 'unsynchronising' tags if the file is only to be processed
   only by ID3v2 aware software and hardware. Unsynchronisation is only
   useful with tags in MPEG 1/2 layer I, II and III, MPEG 2.5 and AAC
   files.


6.1.   The unsynchronisation scheme

   Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed
   byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte. The
   format of synchronisations that should be altered by ID3 encoders is
   as follows:

         %11111111 111xxxxx

   and should be replaced with:

         %11111111 00000000 111xxxxx

   This has the side effect that all $FF 00 combinations have to be
   altered, so they will not be affected by the decoding process.
   Therefore all the $FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the
   $FF 00 00 combination during the unsynchronisation.

   To indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the unsynchronisation
   flag in the frame header should be set. This bit MUST be set if the
   frame was altered by the unsynchronisation and SHOULD NOT be set if
   unaltered. If all frames in the tag are unsynchronised the
   unsynchronisation flag in the tag header SHOULD be set. It MUST NOT
   be set if the tag has a frame which is not unsynchronised.

   Assume the first byte of the audio to be $FF. The special case when
   the last byte of the last frame is $FF and no padding nor footer is
   used will then introduce a false synchronisation. This can be solved
   by adding a footer, adding padding or unsynchronising the frame and
   add $00 to the end of the frame data, thus adding more byte to the
   frame size than a normal unsynchronisation would. Although not
   preferred, it is allowed to apply the last method on all frames
   ending with $FF.

   It is preferred that the tag is either completely unsynchronised or
   not unsynchronised at all. A completely unsynchronised tag has no 
   false synchonisations in it, as defined above, and does not end with
   $FF. A completely non-unsynchronised tag contains no unsynchronised
   frames, and thus the unsynchronisation flag in the header is cleared.

   Do bear in mind, that if compression or encryption is used, the
   unsynchronisation scheme MUST be applied afterwards. When decoding an
   unsynchronised frame, the unsynchronisation scheme MUST be reversed
   first, encryption and decompression afterwards.


6.2.   Synchsafe integers

   In some parts of the tag it is inconvenient to use the
   unsychronisation scheme because the size of unsynchronised data is
   not known in advance, which is particularly problematic with size
   descriptors. The solution in ID3v2 is to use synchsafe integers, in
   which there can never be any false synchs. Synchsafe integers are
   integers that keep its highest bit (bit 7) zeroed, making seven bits
   out of eight available. Thus a 32 bit synchsafe integer can store 28
   bits of information.
   
   Example:
   
     255 (%11111111) encoded as a 16 bit synchsafe integer is 383
     (%00000001 01111111).

Status of this document

   This document is an informal standard and replaces the ID3v2.3.0
   standard [ID3v2]. A formal standard will use another revision number
   even if the content is identical to document. The contents in this
   document may change for clarifications but never for added or altered
   functionallity.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.


Abstract

   This document describes the frames natively supported by ID3v2.4.0,
   which is a revised version of the ID3v2 informal standard [ID3v2.3.0]
   version 2.3.0. The ID3v2 offers a flexible way of storing audio meta
   information within audio file itself. The information may be
   technical information, such as equalisation curves, as well as title,
   performer, copyright etc.

   ID3v2.4.0 is meant to be as close as possible to ID3v2.3.0 in order
   to allow for implementations to be revised as easily as possible.

2.   Conventions in this document

   Text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a tag.
   Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers preceded with %
   are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x
   is used to indicate a bit with unknown content. The most significant
   bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit
   (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.

   A tag is the whole tag described the ID3v2 main structure document
   [ID3v2-strct]. A frame is a block of information in the tag. The tag
   consists of a header, frames and optional padding. A field is a piece
   of information; one value, a string etc. A numeric string is a string
   that consists of the characters "0123456789" only.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


3.   Default flags

   The default settings for the frames described in this document can be
   divided into the following classes. The flags may be set differently
   if found more suitable by the software.

    1. Discarded if tag is altered, discarded if file is altered.

       None.

    2. Discarded if tag is altered, preserved if file is altered.

       None.

    3. Preserved if tag is altered, discarded if file is altered.

       ASPI, AENC, ETCO, EQU2, MLLT, POSS, SEEK, SYLT, SYTC, RVA2, TENC,

4.1.   Unique file identifier

   This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a
   database, that may provide more information relevant to the content.
   Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all
   UFID frames begin with an 'owner identifier' field. It is a null-
   terminated string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a
   link to a location where an email address can be found, that belongs
   to the organisation responsible for this specific database
   implementation. Questions regarding the database should be sent to
   the indicated email address. The URL should not be used for the
   actual database queries. The string
   "http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html" should be used for tests. The
   'Owner identifier' must be non-empty (more than just a termination).
   The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier,
   which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one "UFID" frame
   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.

     <Header for 'Unique file identifier', ID: "UFID">
     Owner identifier        <text string> $00
     Identifier              <up to 64 bytes binary data>


4.2.   Text information frames

   The text information frames are often the most important frames,
   containing information like artist, album and more. There may only be
   one text information frame of its kind in an tag. All text
   information frames supports multiple strings, stored as a null
   separated list, where null is reperesented by the termination code
   for the charater encoding. All text frame identifiers begin with "T".
   Only text frame identifiers begin with "T", with the exception of the
   "TXXX" frame. All the text information frames have the following
   format:

     <Header for 'Text information frame', ID: "T000" - "TZZZ",
     excluding "TXXX" described in 4.2.6.>
     Text encoding                $xx
     Information                  <text string(s) according to encoding>


4.2.1.   Identification frames

  TIT1
   The 'Content group description' frame is used if the sound belongs to
   a larger category of sounds/music. For example, classical music is
   often sorted in different musical sections (e.g. "Piano Concerto",
   "Weather - Hurricane").

  TIT2
   The 'Title/Songname/Content description' frame is the actual name of
   the piece (e.g. "Adagio", "Hurricane Donna").

  TIT3
   The 'Subtitle/Description refinement' frame is used for information
   directly related to the contents title (e.g. "Op. 16" or "Performed
   live at Wembley").

  TALB
   The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the
   recording (or source of sound) from which the audio in the file is
   taken.

  TOAL
   The 'Original album/movie/show title' frame is intended for the title
   of the original recording (or source of sound), if for example the
   music in the file should be a cover of a previously released song.

  TRCK
   The 'Track number/Position in set' frame is a numeric string
   containing the order number of the audio-file on its original
   recording. This MAY be extended with a "/" character and a numeric
   string containing the total number of tracks/elements on the original
   recording. E.g. "4/9".

  TPOS
   The 'Part of a set' frame is a numeric string that describes which
   part of a set the audio came from. This frame is used if the source
   described in the "TALB" frame is divided into several mediums, e.g. a
   double CD. The value MAY be extended with a "/" character and a
   numeric string containing the total number of parts in the set. E.g.
   "1/2".

  TSST
   The 'Set subtitle' frame is intended for the subtitle of the part of
   a set this track belongs to.

  TSRC
   The 'ISRC' frame should contain the International Standard Recording
   Code [ISRC] (12 characters).


4.2.2.   Involved persons frames

  TPE1
   The 'Lead artist/Lead performer/Soloist/Performing group' is
   used for the main artist.

  TPE2
   The 'Band/Orchestra/Accompaniment' frame is used for additional
   information about the performers in the recording.

  TPE3
   The 'Conductor' frame is used for the name of the conductor.

  TPE4
   The 'Interpreted, remixed, or otherwise modified by' frame contains
   more information about the people behind a remix and similar
   interpretations of another existing piece.

  TOPE
   The 'Original artist/performer' frame is intended for the performer
   of the original recording, if for example the music in the file
   should be a cover of a previously released song.

  TEXT
   The 'Lyricist/Text writer' frame is intended for the writer of the
   text or lyrics in the recording.

  TOLY
   The 'Original lyricist/text writer' frame is intended for the
   text writer of the original recording, if for example the music in
   the file should be a cover of a previously released song.

  TCOM
   The 'Composer' frame is intended for the name of the composer.

  TMCL
   The 'Musician credits list' is intended as a mapping between
   instruments and the musician that played it. Every odd field is an
   instrument and every even is an artist or a comma delimited list of
   artists.

  TIPL
   The 'Involved people list' is very similar to the musician credits
   list, but maps between functions, like producer, and names.

  TENC
   The 'Encoded by' frame contains the name of the person or
   organisation that encoded the audio file. This field may contain a
   copyright message, if the audio file also is copyrighted by the
   encoder.


4.2.3.   Derived and subjective properties frames

  TBPM
   The 'BPM' frame contains the number of beats per minute in the
   main part of the audio. The BPM is an integer and represented as a
   numerical string.

  TLEN
   The 'Length' frame contains the length of the audio file in
   milliseconds, represented as a numeric string.

  TKEY
   The 'Initial key' frame contains the musical key in which the sound
   starts. It is represented as a string with a maximum length of three
   characters. The ground keys are represented with "A","B","C","D","E",
   "F" and "G" and halfkeys represented with "b" and "#". Minor is
   represented as "m", e.g. "Dbm" $00. Off key is represented with an
   "o" only.

  TLAN
   The 'Language' frame should contain the languages of the text or
   lyrics spoken or sung in the audio. The language is represented with
   three characters according to ISO-639-2 [ISO-639-2]. If more than one
   language is used in the text their language codes should follow
   according to the amount of their usage, e.g. "eng" $00 "sve" $00.

  TCON
   The 'Content type', which ID3v1 was stored as a one byte numeric
   value only, is now a string. You may use one or several of the ID3v1
   types as numerical strings, or, since the category list would be
   impossible to maintain with accurate and up to date categories,
   define your own. Example: "21" $00 "Eurodisco" $00

   You may also use any of the following keywords:
   
     RX  Remix
     CR  Cover

  TFLT
   The 'File type' frame indicates which type of audio this tag defines.
   The following types and refinements are defined:

     MIME   MIME type follows
     MPG    MPEG Audio
       /1     MPEG 1/2 layer I
       /2     MPEG 1/2 layer II
       /3     MPEG 1/2 layer III
       /2.5   MPEG 2.5
       /AAC   Advanced audio compression
     VQF    Transform-domain Weighted Interleave Vector Quantisation
     PCM    Pulse Code Modulated audio

   but other types may be used, but not for these types though. This is
   used in a similar way to the predefined types in the "TMED" frame,
   but without parentheses. If this frame is not present audio type is
   assumed to be "MPG".

  TMED
   The 'Media type' frame describes from which media the sound
   originated. This may be a text string or a reference to the
   predefined media types found in the list below. Example:
   "VID/PAL/VHS" $00.

   The 'Copyright message' frame, in which the string must begin with a
   year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for
   the copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file
   itself. The absence of this frame means only that the copyright
   information is unavailable or has been removed, and must not be
   interpreted to mean that the audio is public domain. Every time this
   field is displayed the field must be preceded with "Copyright " (C) "
   ", where (C) is one character showing a C in a circle.

  TPRO
   The 'Produced notice' frame, in which the string must begin with a
   year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for
   the production copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio
   file itself. The absence of this frame means only that the production
   copyright information is unavailable or has been removed, and must
   not be interpreted to mean that the audio is public domain. Every
   time this field is displayed the field must be preceded with
   "Produced " (P) " ", where (P) is one character showing a P in a
   circle.

  TPUB
   The 'Publisher' frame simply contains the name of the label or
   publisher.

  TOWN
   The 'File owner/licensee' frame contains the name of the owner or
   licensee of the file and it's contents.

  TRSN
   The 'Internet radio station name' frame contains the name of the
   internet radio station from which the audio is streamed.

  TRSO
   The 'Internet radio station owner' frame contains the name of the
   owner of the internet radio station from which the audio is
   streamed.

4.2.5.   Other text frames

  TOFN
   The 'Original filename' frame contains the preferred filename for the
   file, since some media doesn't allow the desired length of the
   filename. The filename is case sensitive and includes its suffix.

  TDLY
   The 'Playlist delay' defines the numbers of milliseconds of silence
   that should be inserted before this audio. The value zero indicates
   that this is a part of a multifile audio track that should be played
   continuously.

  TDEN
   The 'Encoding time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
   audio was encoded. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDOR
   The 'Original release time' frame contains a timestamp describing
   when the original recording of the audio was released. Timestamp
   format is described in the ID3v2 structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDRC
   The 'Recording time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
   audio was recorded. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDRL
   The 'Release time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
   audio was first released. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDTG
   The 'Tagging time' frame contains a timestamp describing then the
   audio was tagged. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TSSE
   The 'Software/Hardware and settings used for encoding' frame
   includes the used audio encoder and its settings when the file was
   encoded. Hardware refers to hardware encoders, not the computer on
   which a program was run.

  TSOA
   The 'Album sort order' frame defines a string which should be used
   instead of the album name (TALB) for sorting purposes. E.g. an album
   named "A Soundtrack" might preferably be sorted as "Soundtrack".

  TSOP
   The 'Performer sort order' frame defines a string which should be
   used instead of the performer (TPE2) for sorting purposes.

  TSOT
   The 'Title sort order' frame defines a string which should be used
   instead of the title (TIT2) for sorting purposes.


4.2.6.   User defined text information frame

   This frame is intended for one-string text information concerning the
   audio file in a similar way to the other "T"-frames. The frame body
   consists of a description of the string, represented as a terminated
   string, followed by the actual string. There may be more than one
   "TXXX" frame in each tag, but only one with the same description.

     <Header for 'User defined text information frame', ID: "TXXX">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Description       <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Value             <text string according to encoding>


4.3.   URL link frames

   With these frames dynamic data such as webpages with touring
   information, price information or plain ordinary news can be added to
   the tag. There may only be one URL [URL] link frame of its kind in an
   tag, except when stated otherwise in the frame description. If the
   text string is followed by a string termination, all the following
   information should be ignored and not be displayed. All URL link
   frame identifiers begins with "W". Only URL link frame identifiers
   begins with "W", except for "WXXX". All URL link frames have the
   following format:

     <Header for 'URL link frame', ID: "W000" - "WZZZ", excluding "WXXX"
     described in 4.3.2.>
     URL              <text string>


4.3.1.   URL link frames - details

  WCOM
   The 'Commercial information' frame is a URL pointing at a webpage
   with information such as where the album can be bought. There may be
   more than one "WCOM" frame in a tag, but not with the same content.

  WCOP
   The 'Copyright/Legal information' frame is a URL pointing at a
   webpage where the terms of use and ownership of the file is
   described.

  WOAF
   The 'Official audio file webpage' frame is a URL pointing at a file
   specific webpage.

  WOAR
   The 'Official artist/performer webpage' frame is a URL pointing at
   the artists official webpage. There may be more than one "WOAR" frame
   in a tag if the audio contains more than one performer, but not with
   the same content.

  WOAS
   The 'Official audio source webpage' frame is a URL pointing at the
   official webpage for the source of the audio file, e.g. a movie.

  WORS
   The 'Official Internet radio station homepage' contains a URL
   pointing at the homepage of the internet radio station.

  WPAY
   The 'Payment' frame is a URL pointing at a webpage that will handle
   the process of paying for this file.

  WPUB
   The 'Publishers official webpage' frame is a URL pointing at the
   official webpage for the publisher.


4.3.2.   User defined URL link frame

   This frame is intended for URL [URL] links concerning the audio file
   in a similar way to the other "W"-frames. The frame body consists
   of a description of the string, represented as a terminated string,
   followed by the actual URL. The URL is always encoded with ISO-8859-1
   [ISO-8859-1]. There may be more than one "WXXX" frame in each tag,
   but only one with the same description.

     <Header for 'User defined URL link frame', ID: "WXXX">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Description       <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     URL               <text string>


4.4.   Music CD identifier

   This frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD
   can be identified in databases such as the CDDB [CDDB]. The frame
   consists of a binary dump of the Table Of Contents, TOC, from the CD,
   which is a header of 4 bytes and then 8 bytes/track on the CD plus 8
   bytes for the 'lead out', making a maximum of 804 bytes. The offset
   to the beginning of every track on the CD should be described with a
   four bytes absolute CD-frame address per track, and not with absolute
   time. When this frame is used the presence of a valid "TRCK" frame is
   REQUIRED, even if the CD's only got one track. It is recommended that
   this frame is always added to tags originating from CDs. There may
   only be one "MCDI" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Music CD identifier', ID: "MCDI">
     CD TOC                <binary data>


4.5.   Event timing codes

   This frame allows synchronisation with key events in the audio. The
   header is:

     <Header for 'Event timing codes', ID: "ETCO">
     Time stamp format    $xx

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.

   Followed by a list of key events in the following format:

     Type of event   $xx
     Time stamp      $xx (xx ...)

   The 'Time stamp' is set to zero if directly at the beginning of the
   sound or after the previous event. All events MUST be sorted in
   chronological order. The type of event is as follows:

     $00  padding (has no meaning)
     $01  end of initial silence
     $02  intro start
     $03  main part start
     $04  outro start
     $05  outro end
     $06  verse start
     $07  refrain start
     $08  interlude start
     $09  theme start
     $0A  variation start
     $0B  key change
     $0C  time change
     $0D  momentary unwanted noise (Snap, Crackle & Pop)
     $0E  sustained noise
     $0F  sustained noise end
     $10  intro end
     $11  main part end
     $12  verse end
     $13  refrain end
     $14  theme end
     $15  profanity
     $16  profanity end

     $17-$DF  reserved for future use

     $E0-$EF  not predefined synch 0-F

     $F0-$FC  reserved for future use

     $FD  audio end (start of silence)
     $FE  audio file ends
     $FF  one more byte of events follows (all the following bytes with
          the value $FF have the same function)

   Terminating the start events such as "intro start" is OPTIONAL. The
   'Not predefined synch's ($E0-EF) are for user events. You might want
   to synchronise your music to something, like setting off an explosion
   on-stage, activating a screensaver etc.

   There may only be one "ETCO" frame in each tag.


4.6.   MPEG location lookup table

   To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG [MPEG]
   audio file, frames with time codes in different locations in the file
   might be useful. This ID3v2 frame includes references that the
   software can use to calculate positions in the file. After the frame
   header follows a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should be
   increased for every reference. If this value is two then the first
   reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th
   frame, the 3rd reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the
   'bytes between reference' and 'milliseconds between reference' points
   out bytes and milliseconds respectively.

   Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
   defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
   between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
   a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
   deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
   'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
   in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for
   milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only
   be one "MLLT" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Location lookup table', ID: "MLLT">
     MPEG frames between reference  $xx xx
     Bytes between reference        $xx xx xx
     Milliseconds between reference $xx xx xx
     Bits for bytes deviation       $xx
     Bits for milliseconds dev.     $xx

   Then for every reference the following data is included;

     Deviation in bytes         %xxx....
     Deviation in milliseconds  %xxx....


4.7.   Synchronised tempo codes

   For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece, this
   frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing
   which time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more
   tempo codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time
   part. The tempo is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the
   first byte has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added
   to the first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is
   reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time period, which is
   not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one
   single beat-stroke followed by a beat-free period.

   The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the
   tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for
   the player. All tempo descriptors MUST be sorted in chronological
   order. The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as
   the beat description occurs. There may only be one "SYTC" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Synchronised tempo codes', ID: "SYTC">
     Time stamp format   $xx
     Tempo data          <binary data>

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.


4.8.   Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription

   This frame contains the lyrics of the song or a text transcription of
   other vocal activities. The head includes an encoding descriptor and
   a content descriptor. The body consists of the actual text. The
   'Content descriptor' is a terminated string. If no descriptor is
   entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only. Newline characters
   are allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Unsynchronised
   lyrics/text transcription' frame in each tag, but only one with the
   same language and content descriptor.
                                           该框架包含歌曲的歌词或其他声乐活动的文本转录。头包括编码描述符和内容描述符。正文由实际文本组成。“内容描述符”是一个终止字符串。如果没有输入描述符，“内容描述符”仅为$00(00)。文本中允许使用换行符。每个标签中可能有多个“未同步歌词/文本转录”帧，但只有一个具有相同的语言和内容描述符。

     <Header for 'Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription', ID: "USLT">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     Content descriptor   <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Lyrics/text          <full text string according to encoding>


4.9.   Synchronised lyrics/text

   This is another way of incorporating the words, said or sung lyrics,
   in the audio file as text, this time, however, in sync with the
   audio. It might also be used to describing events e.g. occurring on a
   stage or on the screen in sync with the audio. The header includes a
   content descriptor, represented with as terminated text string. If no
   descriptor is entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only.
	这是另一种将所说或唱的歌词作为文本合并到音频文件中的方法，不过这次要与音频同步。它也可以用来描述发生在舞台上或与音频同步的屏幕上的事件。标头包括一个内容描述符，用终止文本字符串表示。如果没有输入描述符，“内容描述符”仅为$00(00)。
     <Header for 'Synchronised lyrics/text', ID: "SYLT">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     Time stamp format    $xx
     Content type         $xx
     Content descriptor   <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)

   Content type:   $00 is other
                   $01 is lyrics
                   $02 is text transcription
                   $03 is movement/part name (e.g. "Adagio")
                   $04 is events (e.g. "Don Quijote enters the stage")
                   $05 is chord (e.g. "Bb F Fsus")
                   $06 is trivia/'pop up' information
                   $07 is URLs to webpages
                   $08 is URLs to images

   Time stamp format:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.

   The text that follows the frame header differs from that of the
   unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription in one major way. Each
   syllable (or whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by
   the encoder) is a null terminated string followed by a time stamp
   denoting where in the sound file it belongs. Each sync thus has the
   following structure:

     Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)
     Sync identifier (terminator to above string)   $00 (00)
     Time stamp                                     $xx (xx ...)

   The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if
   located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps
   should be sorted in chronological order. The sync can be considered
   as a validator of the subsequent string.

   Newline characters are allowed in all "SYLT" frames and MUST be used
   after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the content type
   $03 - $04.
   换行符允许出现在所有“SYLT”帧中，并且必须在内容类型为$03 - $04的帧中的每个条目(名称，事件等)之后使用。

   A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace
   separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus
   occurring in front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also
   valid for new line characters. A syllable followed by a comma should
   not be broken apart with a sync (both the syllable and the comma
   should be before the sync).

   An example: The "USLT" passage

     "Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"

   would be "SYLT" encoded as:

     "Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 xx xx
     " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx "ing" $00 xx
     xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx

   There may be more than one "SYLT" frame in each tag, but only one
   with the same language and content descriptor.


4.10.   Comments

   This frame is intended for any kind of full text information that
   does not fit in any other frame. It consists of a frame header
   followed by encoding, language and content descriptors and is ended
   with the actual comment as a text string. Newline characters are
   allowed in the comment text string. There may be more than one
   comment frame in each tag, but only one with the same language and
   content descriptor.

     <Header for 'Comment', ID: "COMM">
     Text encoding          $xx
     Language               $xx xx xx
     Short content descrip. <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     The actual text        <full text string according to encoding>


4.11.   Relative volume adjustment (2)

   This is a more subjective frame than the previous ones. It allows the
   user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on each
   channel when the file is played. The purpose is to be able to align
   all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to change the
   volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance adjust the
   audio. The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel
   value, 16 bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving
   +/- 64 dB with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as
   $04 00 and -2 dB is $FC 00. There may be more than one "RVA2" frame
   in each tag, but only one with the same identification string.

     <Header for 'Relative volume adjustment (2)', ID: "RVA2">
     Identification          <text string> $00

   The 'identification' string is used to identify the situation and/or
   device where this adjustment should apply. The following is then
   repeated for every channel

     Type of channel         $xx
     Volume adjustment       $xx xx
     Bits representing peak  $xx
     Peak volume             $xx (xx ...)


   Type of channel:  $00  Other
                     $01  Master volume
                     $02  Front right
                     $03  Front left
                     $04  Back right
                     $05  Back left
                     $06  Front centre
                     $07  Back centre
                     $08  Subwoofer

   Bits representing peak can be any number between 0 and 255. 0 means
   that there is no peak volume field. The peak volume field is always
   padded to whole bytes, setting the most significant bits to zero.


4.12.   Equalisation (2)

   This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
   predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may be
   more than one "EQU2" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
   identification string.

     <Header of 'Equalisation (2)', ID: "EQU2">
     Interpolation method  $xx
     Identification        <text string> $00

   The 'interpolation method' describes which method is preferred when
   an interpolation between the adjustment point that follows. The
   following methods are currently defined:

     $00  Band
          No interpolation is made. A jump from one adjustment level to
          another occurs in the middle between two adjustment points.
     $01  Linear
          Interpolation between adjustment points is linear.

   The 'identification' string is used to identify the situation and/or
   device where this adjustment should apply. The following is then
   repeated for every adjustment point

     Frequency          $xx xx
     Volume adjustment  $xx xx

   The frequency is stored in units of 1/2 Hz, giving it a range from 0
   to 32767 Hz.

   The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel value, 16
   bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving +/- 64 dB
   with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as $04 00
   and -2 dB is $FC 00.

   Adjustment points should be ordered by frequency and one frequency
   should only be described once in the frame.


4.13.   Reverb

   Yet another subjective frame, with which you can adjust echoes of
   different kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce
   in ms. Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should
   be made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the
   amount of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00
   is 0%, $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
   reduction on the first bounce, 50% of that on the second and so on.
   Left to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the
   left speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to
   be played in the right speaker.

   'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the
   right before any reverb is applied, where $00 id 0% and $FF is 100%.
   'Premix right to left' does the same thing, but right to left.
   Setting both premix to $FF would result in a mono output (if the
   reverb is applied symmetric). There may only be one "RVRB" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Reverb', ID: "RVRB">
     Reverb left (ms)                 $xx xx
     Reverb right (ms)                $xx xx
     Reverb bounces, left             $xx
     Reverb bounces, right            $xx
     Reverb feedback, left to left    $xx
     Reverb feedback, left to right   $xx
     Reverb feedback, right to right  $xx
     Reverb feedback, right to left   $xx
     Premix left to right             $xx
     Premix right to left             $xx


4.14.   Attached picture

   This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
   Image format is the MIME type and subtype [MIME] for the image. In
   the event that the MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be
   implied. The "image/png" [PNG] or "image/jpeg" [JFIF] picture format
   should be used when interoperability is wanted. Description is a
   short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
   text string. There may be several pictures attached to one file, each
   in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the same content
   descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture type
   declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
   possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME
   type' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
   The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there
   is the risk of separation of files.

     <Header for 'Attached picture', ID: "APIC">
     Text encoding      $xx
     MIME type          <text string> $00
     Picture type       $xx

4.15.   General encapsulated object

   In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
   'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] represented as
   as a terminated string encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The
   filename is case sensitive and is encoded as 'Encoding'. Then follows
   a content description as terminated string, encoded as 'Encoding'.
   The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The first two
   strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations. MIME type is
   always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than one "GEOB"
   frame in each tag, but only one with the same content descriptor.

     <Header for 'General encapsulated object', ID: "GEOB">
     Text encoding          $xx
     MIME type              <text string> $00
     Filename               <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Content description    <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Encapsulated object    <binary data>


4.16.   Play counter

   This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
   played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
   play. There may only be one "PCNT" frame in each tag. When the
   counter reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the
   counter thus making the counter eight bits bigger.  The counter must
   be at least 32-bits long to begin with.

     <Header for 'Play counter', ID: "PCNT">
     Counter        $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)


4.17.   Popularimeter

   The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
   Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
   playlist that features better audio files more often than others or
   it could be used to profile a person's taste and find other 'good'
   files by comparing people's profiles. The frame contains the email
   address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play counter,
   intended to be increased with one for every time the file is played.
   The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where 1 is
   worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is wanted
   it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all one's, one byte is
   inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter eight bits
   bigger in the same away as the play counter ("PCNT"). There may be
   more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
   email address.

     <Header for 'Popularimeter', ID: "POPM">
     Email to user   <text string> $00
     Rating          $xx
     Counter         $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)


4.18.   Recommended buffer size

   Sometimes the server from which an audio file is streamed is aware of
   transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
   audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
   recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
   flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
   maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audio
   stream. In such case the tag should reside between two MPEG [MPEG]
   frames, if the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next tag
   is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated
   from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of
   the header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are
   generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable
   behaviour from present software/hardware.

   For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed
   tags into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to
   individual connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin
   every transmission with a tag, then this tag should include a
   'recommended buffer size' frame. If the client is connected to a
   arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or multicast, then the
   'recommended buffer size' frame SHOULD be included in every tag.

   The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one
   "RBUF" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Recommended buffer size', ID: "RBUF">
     Buffer size               $xx xx xx
     Embedded info flag        %0000000x
     Offset to next tag        $xx xx xx xx


4.19.   Audio encryption

   This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
   whom. Since standardisation of such encryption scheme is beyond this
   document, all "AENC" frames begin with a terminated string with a
   URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
   email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
   responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
   regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
   specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the
   audio file indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered
   useless.

   After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the
   audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is
   described in frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should
   be left zeroed. After the 'preview length' field follows optionally a
   data block required for decryption of the audio. There may be more
   than one "AENC" frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner
   identifier'.

     <Header for 'Audio encryption', ID: "AENC">
     Owner identifier   <text string> $00
     Preview start      $xx xx
     Preview length     $xx xx
     Encryption info    <binary data>


4.20.   Linked information

   To keep information duplication as low as possible this frame may be
   used to link information from another ID3v2 tag that might reside in
   another audio file or alone in a binary file. It is RECOMMENDED that
   this method is only used when the files are stored on a CD-ROM or
   other circumstances when the risk of file separation is low. The
   frame contains a frame identifier, which is the frame that should be
   linked into this tag, a URL [URL] field, where a reference to the
   file where the frame is given, and additional ID data, if needed.
   Data should be retrieved from the first tag found in the file to
   which this link points. There may be more than one "LINK" frame in a
   tag, but only one with the same contents. A linked frame is to be
   considered as part of the tag and has the same restrictions as if it
   was a physical part of the tag (i.e. only one "RVRB" frame allowed,
   whether it's linked or not).

     <Header for 'Linked information', ID: "LINK">
     Frame identifier        $xx xx xx xx
     URL                     <text string> $00
     ID and additional data  <text string(s)>

   Frames that may be linked and need no additional data are "ASPI",
   "ETCO", "EQU2", "MCID", "MLLT", "OWNE", "RVA2", "RVRB", "SYTC", the
   text information frames and the URL link frames.

   The "AENC", "APIC", "GEOB" and "TXXX" frames may be linked with
   the content descriptor as additional ID data.

   The "USER" frame may be linked with the language field as additional
   ID data.
   
   The "PRIV" frame may be linked with the owner identifier as
   additional ID data.

   The "COMM", "SYLT" and "USLT" frames may be linked with three bytes
   of language descriptor directly followed by a content descriptor as
   additional ID data.


4.21.   Position synchronisation frame

   This frame delivers information to the listener of how far into the
   audio stream he picked up; in effect, it states the time offset from
   the first frame in the stream. The frame layout is:

     <Head for 'Position synchronisation', ID: "POSS">
     Time stamp format         $xx
     Position                  $xx (xx ...)

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   and position is where in the audio the listener starts to receive,
   i.e. the beginning of the next frame. If this frame is used in the
   beginning of a file the value is always 0. There may only be one
   "POSS" frame in each tag.


4.22.   Terms of use frame

   This frame contains a brief description of the terms of use and
   ownership of the file. More detailed information concerning the legal
   terms might be available through the "WCOP" frame. Newlines are
   allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Terms of use' frame
   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Language'.

     <Header for 'Terms of use frame', ID: "USER">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     The actual text      <text string according to encoding>


4.23.   Ownership frame

   The ownership frame might be used as a reminder of a made transaction
   or, if signed, as proof. Note that the "USER" and "TOWN" frames are
   good to use in conjunction with this one. The frame begins, after the
   frame ID, size and encoding fields, with a 'price paid' field. The
   first three characters of this field contains the currency used for
   the transaction, encoded according to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic
   currency code. Concatenated to this is the actual price paid, as a
   numerical string using "." as the decimal separator. Next is an 8
   character date string (YYYYMMDD) followed by a string with the name
   of the seller as the last field in the frame. There may only be one
   "OWNE" frame in a tag.

     <Header for 'Ownership frame', ID: "OWNE">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Price paid        <text string> $00
     Date of purch.    <text string>
     Seller            <text string according to encoding>


4.24.   Commercial frame

   This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by
   bundling all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex
   but it's an easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same
   result with several frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID,
   size and encoding fields, with a price string field. A price is
   constructed by one three character currency code, encoded according
   to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic currency code, followed by a
   numerical value where "." is used as decimal separator. In the price
   string several prices may be concatenated, separated by a "/"
   character, but there may only be one currency of each type.

   The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the
   format YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After
   that is a contact URL, with which the user can contact the seller,
   followed by a one byte 'received as' field. It describes how the
   audio is delivered when bought according to the following list:

        $00  Other
        $01  Standard CD album with other songs
        $02  Compressed audio on CD
        $03  File over the Internet
        $04  Stream over the Internet
        $05  As note sheets
        $06  As note sheets in a book with other sheets
        $07  Music on other media
        $08  Non-musical merchandise

   Next follows a terminated string with the name of the seller followed
   by a terminated string with a short description of the product. The
   last thing is the ability to include a company logotype. The first of
   them is the 'Picture MIME type' field containing information about
   which picture format is used. In the event that the MIME media type
   name is omitted, "image/" will be implied. Currently only "image/png"
   and "image/jpeg" are allowed. This format string is followed by the
   binary picture data. This two last fields may be omitted if no
   picture is attached. There may be more than one 'commercial frame' in
   a tag, but no two may be identical.

     <Header for 'Commercial frame', ID: "COMR">
     Text encoding      $xx
     Price string       <text string> $00
     Valid until        <text string>
     Contact URL        <text string> $00
     Received as        $xx
     Name of seller     <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Description        <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Picture MIME type  <string> $00
     Seller logo        <binary data>


4.25.   Encryption method registration

   To identify with which method a frame has been encrypted the
   encryption method must be registered in the tag with this frame. The
   'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for this specific encryption method. Questions regarding the
   encryption method should be sent to the indicated email address. The
   'Method symbol' contains a value that is associated with this method
   throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
   reserved. The 'Method symbol' may optionally be followed by
   encryption specific data. There may be several "ENCR" frames in a tag
   but only one containing the same symbol and only one containing the
   same owner identifier. The method must be used somewhere in the tag.
   See the description of the frame encryption flag in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct] for more information.

     <Header for 'Encryption method registration', ID: "ENCR">
     Owner identifier    <text string> $00
     Method symbol       $xx
     Encryption data     <binary data>


4.26.   Group identification registration

   This frame enables grouping of otherwise unrelated frames. This can
   be used when some frames are to be signed. To identify which frames
   belongs to a set of frames a group identifier must be registered in
   the tag with this frame. The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated
   string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a link to a
   location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
   organisation responsible for this grouping. Questions regarding the
   grouping should be sent to the indicated email address. The 'Group
   symbol' contains a value that associates the frame with this group
   throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
   reserved. The 'Group symbol' may optionally be followed by some group
   specific data, e.g. a digital signature. There may be several "GRID"
   frames in a tag but only one containing the same symbol and only one
   containing the same owner identifier. The group symbol must be used
   somewhere in the tag. See the description of the frame grouping flag
   in the ID3v2 structure document [ID3v2-strct] for more information.

     <Header for 'Group ID registration', ID: "GRID">
     Owner identifier      <text string> $00
     Group symbol          $xx
     Group dependent data  <binary data>


4.27.   Private frame

   This frame is used to contain information from a software producer
   that its program uses and does not fit into the other frames. The
   frame consists of an 'Owner identifier' string and the binary data.
   The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for the frame. Questions regarding the frame should be sent to the
   indicated email address. The tag may contain more than one "PRIV"
   frame but only with different contents.

     <Header for 'Private frame', ID: "PRIV">
     Owner identifier      <text string> $00
     The private data      <binary data>


4.28.   Signature frame

   This frame enables a group of frames, grouped with the 'Group
   identification registration', to be signed. Although signatures can
   reside inside the registration frame, it might be desired to store
   the signature elsewhere, e.g. in watermarks. There may be more than
   one 'signature frame' in a tag, but no two may be identical.

     <Header for 'Signature frame', ID: "SIGN">
     Group symbol      $xx
     Signature         <binary data>


4.29.   Seek frame

   This frame indicates where other tags in a file/stream can be found.
   The 'minimum offset to next tag' is calculated from the end of this
   tag to the beginning of the next. There may only be one 'seek frame'
   in a tag.

   <Header for 'Seek frame', ID: "SEEK">
   Minimum offset to next tag       $xx xx xx xx


4.30.   Audio seek point index

   Audio files with variable bit rates are intrinsically difficult to
   deal with in the case of seeking within the file. The ASPI frame
   makes seeking easier by providing a list a seek points within the
   audio file. The seek points are a fractional offset within the audio
   data, providing a starting point from which to find an appropriate
   point to start decoding. The presence of an ASPI frame requires the
   existence of a TLEN frame, indicating the duration of the file in
   milliseconds. There may only be one 'audio seek point index' frame in
   a tag.

     <Header for 'Seek Point Index', ID: "ASPI">
     Indexed data start (S)         $xx xx xx xx
     Indexed data length (L)        $xx xx xx xx
     Number of index points (N)     $xx xx
     Bits per index point (b)       $xx

   Then for every index point the following data is included;

     Fraction at index (Fi)          $xx (xx)

   'Indexed data start' is a byte offset from the beginning of the file.
   'Indexed data length' is the byte length of the audio data being
   indexed. 'Number of index points' is the number of index points, as
   the name implies. The recommended number is 100. 'Bits per index
   point' is 8 or 16, depending on the chosen precision. 8 bits works
   well for short files (less than 5 minutes of audio), while 16 bits is
   advantageous for long files. 'Fraction at index' is the numerator of
   the fraction representing a relative position in the data. The
   denominator is 2 to the power of b.

   Here are the algorithms to be used in the calculation. The known data
   must be the offset of the start of the indexed data (S), the offset
   of the end of the indexed data (E), the number of index points (N),
   the offset at index i (Oi). We calculate the fraction at index i
   (Fi).

   Oi is the offset of the frame whose start is soonest after the point
   for which the time offset is (i/N * duration).

   The frame data should be calculated as follows:

     Fi = Oi/L * 2^b    (rounded down to the nearest integer)

   Offset calculation should be calculated as follows from data in the
   frame:

     Oi = (Fi/2^b)*L    (rounded up to the nearest integer)

                    ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Changes

Status of this document

   This document describes the changes between ID3v2.3.0 [ID3v2.3.0] and
   ID3v2.4.0 [ID3v2.4.0-strct][ID3v2.4.0-frames]. This document does not
   claim to be complete nor correct. 

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.


Abstract

   This document outlines the more important differences between
   ID3v2.3.0 and ID3v2.4.0. In general ID3v.2.4.0 can be said to be more
   consistent and easier to implement and more suitable to real world
   conditions than the previous versions.

2.   Conventions in this document

   References to sections in the ID3v2.4.0 Main Structure
   [ID3v2.4.0-strct] document will be given as [S:x.y] where x is the
   section and y is the subsection. In a similar fashion references to
   sections in the ID3v2.4.0 Native Frames [ID3v2.4.0-frames] document
   will be given as [F:x.y].


3.   Tag structure changes

   The location of tags in a file as well as methods to find and merge
   tags are far better defined in ID3v2.4.0 [S:5] than previous
   versions. A reverse search for tags are improved by the addition of a
   tag footer [S:3.4]. A tag footer flag has been added to the header
   flags to indicate the presence of a ID3v2 footer, hence the size
   field is not affected by the footer [S:3.1].

   The extended header has been completely rewritten [S:3.2] and can not
   produce false synchs. It is also possible to indicate artificial tag
   restrictions in the extended header, for use with thinner clients.
   
   Unsynchronisation [S:6.1] is done on frame level, instead of on tag
   level, making it easier to skip frames, increasing the streamability
   of the tag. The unsynchronisation flag in the header [S:3.1]
   indicates if all frames has been unsynchronized, while the new
   unsynchronisation flag in the frame header [S:4.1.2] indicates
   unsynchronisation. To avoid false synchronisations in the frame
   header the size description and flag field has been rewritten [S:4].
   Resynchronisation of the complete tag when the unsynchronisation flag
   in the tag header is set might result in a corrupt tag.

   The character encodings UTF-16BE and UTF-8 has been added to the list
   of valid encodings [S:4].


4.   Deprecated ID3v2 frames

  EQUA - Equalization
    This frame is replaced by the EQU2 frame, 'Equalisation (2)'
    [F:4.12].

  IPLS - Involved people list
    This frame is replaced by the two frames TMCL, 'Musician credits
    list' [F:4.2.2], and TIPL, 'Involved people list' [F:4.2.2].

  RVAD - Relative volume adjustment
    This frame is replaced by the RVA2 frame, 'Relative volume
    adjustment (2)' [F:4.11].
    
  TDAT - Date
    This frame is replaced by the TDRC frame, 'Recording time'
    [F:4.2.5].
    
  TIME - Time
    This frame is replaced by the TDRC frame, 'Recording time'
    [F:4.2.5].
    
  TORY - Original release year
    This frame is replaced by the TDOR frame, 'Original release time'
    [F:4.2.5].
    
  TRDA - Recording dates
    This frame is replaced by the TDRC frame, 'Recording time'
    [F:4.2.5].
    
  TSIZ - Size
    The information contained in this frame is in the general case
    either trivial to calculate for the player or impossible for the
    tagger to calculate. There is however no good use for such
    information. The frame is therefore completely deprecated.
    
  TYER - Year
    This frame is replaced by the TDRC frame, 'Recording time'
    [F:4.2.5].
