# 1. ID3 tag version 2.3.0

## 1.1 文档情况

本文档是一个非正式的标准，取代了id3v2.2.0标准。非正式标准的发布使得实现者可以在正式标准设定之前就有了一个设定的标准。正式标准如果与本文档描述的不一致，将使用另一个版本或修订号。本文档中的内容可能会因说明而更改，但绝不会因添加或更改功能而更改。



本文件不受限制地分发。

## 1.2 摘要

本文档描述了ID3v2.3.0标准，它是ID3v2非正式标准(版本[:ID3v2 -00: 2.2.0])的更完善版本，从ID3标记系统发展而来。ID3v2提供了一种灵活的方法，可以在其内部存储关于音频文件的信息，以确定其来源和内容。这些信息可以是技术信息，如均衡曲线，也可以是相关元信息，如标题、表演者、版权等。

# 2. 文档惯例

在这些例子中，“”中的文本是一个文本字符串，与它在文件中出现的一模一样。前面带\$的数字是十六进制数字，前面带%的数字是二进制数字。$xx用于表示内容未知的字节。%x用于表示内容未知的位。一个字节的最高有效位(MSB)称为“位7”，最低有效位(LSB)称为“位0”。



标签是本文档中描述的整个标签。帧是标记中的信息块。标签由header、帧和可选填充组成。一个字段是一条信息;一个值，一个字符串等等。数字字符串是仅由字符0-9组成的字符串。

# 3. ID3v2 overview

最大的两个设计目标是能够在不过多干扰旧软件的情况下实现ID3v2，并且ID3v2应该尽可能地灵活和可扩展。



第一个条件是满足一个简单的事实，即MPEG解码软件使用嵌入在音频流中的同步信号来“锁定”音频。因为ID3v2标记不包含有效的同步信号，所以没有软件会尝试播放该标记。如果，出于任何原因，巧合使同步信号出现在标签内，它将由第5节中描述的“非同步方案”处理。



第二个标准对ID3v2标签的设计产生了更明显的影响。它被构造为几个信息块(称为帧)的容器，遇到它们的软件不需要知道它们的格式。在每一帧的开始都有一个标识符来解释帧的格式和内容，以及一个允许软件跳过未知帧的大小描述符。



如果需要对ID3v2标记进行全面修订，则在ID3v2标头中有版本号和大小描述符。



本文档中描述的ID3标记主要针对MPEG-1/2 layer I、MPEG-1/2 layer II、 MPEG-1/2 layer III和MPEG-2.5编码的文件，但也可以用于其他类型的编码音频。



ID3v2中的位序是最高位优先(MSB)。多字节数字中的字节顺序是最高位优先(例如\$12345678将被编码为$12 34 56 78)。



允许在所有最终帧之后(在ID3标签的末尾)包含填充，使所有帧的大小加在一起小于标签头部给出的大小。这种填充的一个可能的目的是允许在标记中添加一些额外的帧或扩大现有的帧，而不必重写整个文件。填充字节的值必须为$00。

## 3.1 ID3v2 header

ID3v2标签头应该是文件中的第一个信息，长度为10字节，如下所示:

```c++
ID3v2/file identifier   "ID3" 
ID3v2 version           $03 00
ID3v2 flags             %abc00000
ID3v2 size              4 * %0xxxxxxx
```

标记的前三个字节总是“ID3”，表示这是一个ID3v2标记，后面直接跟着两个版本字节。ID3v2版本的第一个字节是它的主版本，而第二个字节是它的修订号。在本例中，这是ID3v2.3.0。所有修订都是向后兼容的，而主要版本则不是。如果支持ID3v2.2.0及以下版本的软件遇到版本3或更高版本，则应该直接忽略整个标记。版本和修订永远不会是$FF。



该版本后面是ID3v2 flags字段，其中目前只使用了三个标志。

* **a - Unsynchronisation （非同步）**

  'ID3v2标志'中的第7位表示是否使用非同步(详情请参阅**第5节**);设置位表示使用情况。

* **b - Extended header （扩展头部）**

  第二个比特(比特6)表示头之后是否有扩展头。扩展头在**3.2节**中描述。

* **c - Experimental indicator（实验指示器）**

  第三位(第5位)应该用作“实验指示器”。当标签处于实验阶段时，应该始终设置此标志。



所有其他标志都应该被清除。如果设置了这些未定义的标志之一，则可能意味着该标记对于不知道标志功能的解析器来说是不可读的。



ID3v2标签大小用四个字节编码，其中每个字节的最高位(第7位)设置为0，总共为28位。零位将被忽略，因此257字节长的标记表示为$00 00 02 01。



ID3v2标签大小是不同步后的完整标签大小，包括填充，不包括标题，但不排除扩展标题(标签总大小 -$_{减号}$ 10)。在大小描述中只使用了28位(代表最多256MB)，以避免引入“错误同步信号”。



ID3v2标签可以用以下模式检测到:

```c++
$49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
 I  D  3
```

其中`yy`小于\$FF, xx是`flags`字节，`zz`小于$80。

## 3.2 ID3v2 extended header

扩展头包含的信息对于正确解析标记信息并不重要，因此扩展头是可选的。

```c++
Extended header size   $xx xx xx xx
Extended Flags         $xx xx
Size of padding        $xx xx xx xx
```

其中'扩展头大小(Extended header size )'，目前6或10字节，不包括自己。“填充的大小(Size of padding)”只是总的标签大小，不包括帧和报头，换句话说就是填充。扩展头被认为与头本身是分开的，因此受到不同步的影响。

扩展标志（Extended Flags）是描述标签进一步属性的辅助标志集。这些属性当前的定义如下：

```c++
%x0000000 00000000 // 二进制
```

* **x - CRC data present**

  如果设置了这个标志，就会有四个字节的CRC-32数据被追加到扩展头中。CRC应该在扩展报头和填充之间的数据不同步之前计算，即帧和仅帧。

  ```c++
  Total frame CRC    $xx xx xx xx // 十六进制
  ```

## 3.3 ID3v2 frame overview

由于标签由标签头和带有一个或多个帧的标签体组成，所有的帧都由一个帧头后面跟着一个或多个包含实际信息的字段组成。帧头的布局:

```c++
Frame ID       $xx xx xx xx (four characters)
Size           $xx xx xx xx
Flags          $xx xx
```

由大写字母A-Z和0-9组成的帧ID。以“X”、“Y”和“Z”开头的标识符是供实验使用的，每个人都可以免费使用，而不需要在标记头中设置实验位。请记住，其他人可能使用了与您相同的标识符。所有其他标识符都被使用或保留以供将来使用。



帧ID后面跟着一个大小描述符，使得每帧的报头总大小为10字节。尺寸计算为不包括帧头的帧大小(帧大小 - 10)。



在帧报头中，大小描述符后面跟着两个标志字节。这些标志在3.3.1节中描述。



标签中帧的出现没有固定的顺序，尽管我们希望帧按照文件识别的重要性顺序排列。例如:UFID, TIT2, MCDI, TRCK…



一个标签必须至少包含一个帧。一个帧必须至少1字节大，不包括报头。



如果没有其他说明，则字符串表示为ISO-8859-1字符，范围为\$20 - \$FF。在帧描述中，这样的字符串表示为\<text string>，或者\<full text string>(如果允许换行)。所有Unicode字符串使用16位Unicode 2.0 (ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993, UCS-2)。Unicode字符串必须以Unicode BOM ($FF FE或\$FE FF)开头，以标识字节顺序。



所有数字字符串和url总是按照ISO-8859-1编码。如果使用ISO-8859-1编码，终止的字符串将以\$00结束，如果使用unicode编码，则以\$00 00结束。如果没有其他说明，则禁止换行符。在ISO-8859-1中，如果允许，新行仅用\$0A表示。允许不同类型的文本编码的帧在帧大小后面有一个文本编码描述字节。如果使用ISO-8859-1，这个字节应该是\$00，如果使用Unicode，它应该是\$01

依赖于编码的字符串被呈现为\<text string according to encoding>，或者如果允许换行，被呈现为\<full text string according to encoding>。任何以NULL结束的空Unicode字符串都可能有Unicode BOM后面跟着Unicode NULL (\$FF FE 00 00或$FE FF 00 00)。



根据ISO-639-2, 3字节语言字段用于描述帧内容的语言。



所有的url都可能是相对的，例如。“picture.png”、“. . / doc.txt”。



如果一个帧比它应该的长度长，例如有比本文档中指定的更多的字段，这表明在ID3v2标准的后续版本中对该帧进行了添加。这反映在标签头部的修订号上。

### 3.3.1. Frame header flags

在帧头中，大小描述符后面跟着两个标志字节。所有未使用的标志必须清除。第一个字节用于“状态消息”，第二个字节用于编码。如果在第一个字节中设置了一个未知标志，在不清除该位的情况下，帧不能被更改。如果在第二个字节中设置了未知标志，则可能不可读。flags字段的定义如下。

```c++
%abc00000 %ijk00000
```

* **a - Tag alter preservation（标记更改保留）**

  这个标志告诉软件，如果这个帧是未知的，并且标签以任何方式改变了，该如何处理这个帧。这适用于所有类型的更改，包括添加更多的填充和重新排序帧。

  ```c++
  0    Frame should be preserved(保留).
  1    Frame should be discarded(丢弃).
  ```

* **b - File alter preservation（文件更改保留）**

  这个标志告诉软件，如果这个帧是未知的，并且文件(不包括标签)被改变了，该如何处理这个帧。当音频完全被其他音频数据取代时，这就不适用了。

  ```c++
  0    Frame should be preserved.
  1    Frame should be discarded.
  ```

* **c - Read only**

  如果设置了这个标志，告诉软件这个帧的内容是只读的。更改内容可能会破坏某些东西，例如签名。如果改变了内容，不知道为什么帧被标记为只读，也不采取适当的补偿手段，例如重新计算签名，则应该清除该位。

* **i - Compression(压缩)**

  这个标志表示帧是否被压缩。

  ```c++
  0    Frame is not compressed.
  1    Frame is compressed using [#ZLIB zlib] with 4 bytes for 'decompressed size' appended to the frame header.
  ```

* **j - Encryption(加密)**

  这个标志表示帧是否加密。如果设置了一个字节，表明它是用哪种方法加密的，将被追加到帧头。**参见4.26节**。有关加密方法注册的详细信息。

  ```c++
  0   Frame is not encrypted.
  1    Frame is encrypted.
  ```

* **k - Grouping identity**

  该标志表示该帧是否与其他帧属于一个组。如果设置了组标识符，则将字节添加到帧头。每个具有相同组标识符的帧都属于同一个组。

  ```c++
  0    Frame does not contain group information
  1    Frame contains group information
  ```

有些标志表示帧报头扩展了附加信息。该信息将被添加到帧头中，其顺序与表示添加的标志相同。也就是说，解压后的四个字节的大小将在加密方法字节之前。这些附加到帧头的内容，虽然不包含在帧报头大小中，但包含在'frame size'字段中，不受加密或压缩的影响。

## 3.4. Default flags

本文档中描述的帧的默认设置可以分为以下类。如果软件发现更合适，标志可以设置不同。

1. 如果标签被改变就丢弃，如果文件被改变就丢弃。

   None.

2. 如果标签被改变，则丢弃;如果文件被改变，则保留。

   None.

3. 如果标签被改变，则保留;如果文件被改变，则丢弃。

   AENC, ETCO, EQUA, MLLT, POSS, SYLT, SYTC, RVAD, TENC, TLEN, TSIZ

4. 如果标签被更改则保留，如果文件被更改则保留。

## 4.1. Unique file identifier(唯一文件标识符)

这个frame的目的是能够识别数据库中可能包含更多与内容相关的信息的音频文件。由于这种数据库的标准化超出了本文档的范围，因此所有frame都以一个以null-terminated的字符串开始，其中包含一个包含电子邮件地址的URL，或一个指向可以找到电子邮件地址的位置的链接，该位置属于负责该特定数据库实现的组织。有关数据库的问题应发送到指定的电子邮件地址。URL不应该用于实际的数据库查询。字符串“http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html”应该用于测试。没有被告知的软件可以安全地删除这样的frames。'Owner identifier'必须非空(不仅仅是一个终止符)。'Owner identifier'后面跟着实际的标识符，最长可达64字节。标签中可能有多个“UFID”帧，但只有一个具有相同的'Owner identifier'。

```c++
<Header for 'Unique file identifier', ID: "UFID">
Owner identifier    <text string> $00
Identifier    <up to 64 bytes binary data>
```

## 4.2. Text information frames

文本信息帧是最重要的帧，包含艺术家、专辑等信息。一个标签中可能只有一个文本信息帧。如果文本字符串后面跟着一个终止符($00(00))，所有以下信息都应该被忽略并且不被展示。所有文本帧标识符都以“T”开头。**只有文本帧标识符以“T”开头，“TXXX”帧除外。**所有文本信息帧的格式如下: 

```c++
<Header for 'Text information frame', ID: "T000" - "TZZZ", excluding "TXXX" described in 4.2.2.>
Text encoding    $xx
Information    <text string according to encoding>
```

### 4.2.1. Text information frames - details

* **TALB**

  'Album/Movie/Show title'  帧 用于记录文件中(/声源)音频的标题。

* **TBPM**

  “BPM”帧包含音频主要部分的每分钟节拍数。BPM是一个整数，用数字字符串表示。

* **TCOM**

  'Composer(s)'框架用于表示作曲家的名字。它们用“/”字符分隔。Tom/Jerry/...

* **TCON**

  “Content type”以前仅存储为一个字节的数值，现在是一个数值字符串。您可以像ID3v1.1那样使用一种或几种类型，或者，由于不可能使用准确和最新的类别来维护类别列表，所以您可以定义自己的类别。

  ID3v1类型的引用可以通过输入“(”作为第一个字节，后面跟着一个类型列表中的数字(**附录a**)，并以“)”字符结束。这后面可选地跟着一个(refinement)细化，例如。“(21)”或“(4)欧洲迪斯科”。在同一个框架中可以有多个引用，例如:“(51)(39)”。如果(refinement)细化应该以“(”字符开始，它应该替换为“((”，例如:“(我能想出任何流派)”或“(55)((我认为……)”。以下新内容类型在ID3v2中定义，并以与数字内容类型相同的方式实现，例如:“(RX)”。

  ```c++
  RX    Remix
  CR    Cover
  ```

  

* **TCOP**

  “Copyright message'”帧必须以年份和一个空格字符开头(5个字符)，是为原始声音的版权所有者准备的，而不是音频文件本身。没有这个框架只意味着版权信息不可用或已被删除，不能被解释为声音属于公共领域。每次显示此字段时，该字段前必须加上“Copyright ©”。

* **TDAT**

  'Date'帧是DDMM格式的数字字符串，包含记录的日期。这个字段总是四个字符长。

* **TDLY**

  “Playlist delay”定义了播放列表中每首歌曲之间沉默的毫秒数。player 应该使用“ETC”帧，如果存在，跳过初始沉默和音频结束时的沉默，以匹配“Playlist delay”时间。时间表示为数字字符串。

* **TENC**

  “Encoded by”帧包含对音频文件进行编码的个人或组织的名称。如果音频文件也受编码器的版权保护，则此字段可能包含版权信息。

* **TEXT**

  “Lyricist(s) / Text writer(s)”（歌词和歌词作者）帧是针对录音中文字或歌词的作者。它们用“/”字符分隔。

* **TFLT**

  'File type'帧表示该标记定义的音频类型。定义了以下类型和细化(refinements):

  ```c++
  MPG       MPEG Audio
  /1        MPEG 1/2 layer I
  /2        MPEG 1/2 layer II
  /3        MPEG 1/2 layer III
  /2.5      MPEG 2.5
   /AAC     Advanced audio compression
  VQF       Transform-domain Weighted Interleave Vector Quantization
  PCM       Pulse Code Modulated audio
  ```
  但也可以使用其他类型，但不是针对这些类型。它的使用方式类似于“TMED”框架中的预定义类型，但没有括号。如果此帧不存在，则假定音频类型为“MPG”。
  
* **TIME**

  “Time”帧是HHMM格式的数字字符串，包含录制的时间。这个字段总是四个字符长。

* **TIT1**

  如果声音属于更大的声音/音乐类别，则使用“Content group description” frame。例如，古典音乐通常被分类在不同的音乐部分(例如:古典音乐)。(《钢琴协奏曲》、《天气-飓风》)。

* **TIT2**

  “Title/Songname/Content description” frame 是作品的实际名称(例如:“慢板”，“飓风唐娜”)。

* **TIT3**

  “Subtitle/Description refine” frame 用于与内容标题直接相关的信息(例如: “Op. 16”或“温布利现场演出”)。

* **TKEY**

  “Initial key”帧包含声音开始的音乐键。它表示为一个最大长度为3个字符的字符串。ground keys用“A”、“B”、“C”、“D”、“E”、“F”和“G”表示，halfkeys 用“B”和“#”表示。Minor 用“m”表示。例如：“Cbm”。Off key仅用“o”表示。

* **TLAN**

  'Language(s)' frame 应该包含在音频中说或唱的文本或歌词的语言。根据ISO-639-2，该语言由三个字符表示。如果文本中使用了一种以上的语言，那么它们的语言代码应该根据它们的用法来跟随。

* **TLEN**

  “Length”帧包含音频文件的长度，以毫秒为单位，以数字字符串表示。

* **TMED**

  'Media type' 帧 描述声音来自哪个媒体。这可能是一个文本字符串，也可能是对下面列表中预定义媒体类型的引用。引用在“(”和“)”中进行，并可选地后跟文本细化(text refinement)，例如:“(MC)有四个频道”。如果文本细化(text refinement)以“(”字符开始，则应以“((”替换，方法与“TCO”框架相同。预定义的细化附加在媒体类型之后，例如:(CD/A)或(VID/PAL/VHS)。

* **TOAL**

  'Original album/movie/show title' frame 用于原始录音的标题(或声音来源)，例如，如果文件中的音乐应该是之前发布的歌曲的翻唱。

* **TOFN**

   'Original filename'  帧 包含文件的更好的文件名，因为一些媒体不允许所需的文件名长度。文件名区分大小写，并包含其后缀。

* **TOLY**

  'Original lyricist(s)/text writer(s)'  frame 用于原始录音的文本作者，例如，如果文件中的音乐应该是之前发布的歌曲的翻唱。文本写入器由“/”字符分隔。

* **TOPE**

  'Original artist(s)/performer(s)'  frame 用于原始录音的表演者，例如，如果文件中的音乐应该是先前发布的歌曲的翻唱。表演者由“/”字符分隔。

* **TORY**

  'Original release year' frame 是指原始唱片发行的年份，例如，如果文件中的音乐应该是之前发行过的歌曲的翻唱。该字段的格式与“TYER” frame 相同。

* **TOWN**

  'File owner/licensee' frame 包含文件所有者或被许可方的名称及其内容。

* **TSSE**

  'Software/Hardware and settings used for encoding' frame 包括使用的音频编码器及其在文件编码时的设置。硬件是指硬件编码器，而不是运行程序的计算机。

* **TYER**

  'Year'帧是记录年份的数字字符串。这个帧总是四个字符长(直到10000年)。

### 4.2.2. User defined text information frame

此帧用于与其他“T”帧类似的关于音频文件的单字符串文本信息。帧体由字符串的描述组成，以终止字符串表示，后面跟着实际字符串。每个标签中可能有多个“TXXX”帧，但只有一个具有相同的描述。

```C++
<Header for 'User defined text information frame', ID: "TXXX">
Text encoding    $xx
Description    <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
Value    <text string according to encoding>
```

## 4.3. URL link frames

有了这些框架，动态数据，如网页旅游信息，价格信息或普通新闻可以添加到标签。一个标签中只能有一个URL链接帧，除非在帧描述中另有说明。如果文本字符串后面跟着一个终止符($00(00))，所有以下信息都应该被忽略，不显示。所有URL链接帧标识符都以“W”开头。只有URL链接帧标识符以“W”开头。所有URL链接帧都有以下格式:

```C++
<Header for 'URL link frame', ID: "W000" - "WZZZ", excluding "WXXX" described in 4.3.2.>
URL <text string>
```

### 4.3.1. URL link frames - details

* **WORS**

  'Official internet radio station homepage' frame 包含一个指向互联网电台主页的URL。

* **WPAY**

  “Payment” frame 是一个指向网页的URL，该网页将处理此文件的支付过程。

* **WPUB**

  'Publishers official webpage' frame 是一个指向出版商官方网页的URL。

### 4.3.2. User defined URL link frame

该帧用于与音频文件相关的URL链接，与其他“W”帧类似。帧主体由字符串的描述组成，以终止字符串表示，后面跟着实际的URL。URL总是用ISO-8859-1编码。每个标签中可能有多个“WXXX”帧，但只有一个具有相同的描述。

```c++
<Header for 'User defined URL link frame', ID: "WXXX">
Text encoding    $xx
Description    <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
URL    <text string>
```

## 4.4. Involved people list

由于可能有很多人以各种方式为音频文件做出贡献，例如音乐家和技术人员，'Text information frames'(“文本信息帧”)通常不足以列出参与项目的每个人。 ’Involved people list‘(“涉及人员名单”)是一个包含涉及人员姓名和涉及方式的框架。主体简单地包含一个带有介入人员的终止字符串，然后直接又是一个新的带有介入人员的终止字符串，依此类推。每个标签中可能只有一个“IPLS”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Involved people list', ID: "IPLS">
Text encoding    $xx
People list strings    <text strings according to encoding>
```

## 4.5. Music CD identifier

此框架用于来自CD的音乐，以便能够在CDDB等数据库中识别CD。帧由CD目录的二进制转储TOC组成，它是一个4字节的头，然后CD上的 8 bytes/track 加上8字节的'lead out'，最大804字节。CD上每个音轨开始的偏移量应该用每个音轨四个字节的绝对CD帧地址来描述，而不是用绝对时间。这个frame需要一个当前有效的“TRCK”frame ，即使CD只有一个track。每个标记中可能只有一个“MCDI”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Music CD identifier', ID: "MCDI">
CD TOC <binary data>
```

## 4.6. Event timing codes

这个框架允许与歌曲或声音中的关键事件同步。header是:

```c++
<Header for 'Event timing codes', ID: "ETCO">
Time stamp format    $xx
```

其中时间戳格式为:

```c++
$01 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
$02 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
```

Abolute time 意味着每个戳包含从文件开始的时间。

下面是关键事件的列表，格式如下:

```c++
Type of event   $xx
Time stamp      $xx (xx ...)
```

'Time stamp' 如果直接在声音的开头或在前一个事件之后被设置为零。所有事件都应按时间顺序排列。事件类型如下:

```c++
$00     padding (has no meaning)
$01     end of initial silence
$02     intro start
$03     mainpart start
$04     outro start
$05     outro end
$06     verse start
$07     refrain start
$08     interlude start
$09     theme start
$0A     variation start
$0B     key change
$0C     time change
$0D     momentary unwanted noise (Snap, Crackle & Pop)
$0E     sustained noise
$0F     sustained noise end
$10     intro end
$11     mainpart end
$12     verse end
$13     refrain end
$14     theme end
$15-$DF reserved for future use
$E0-$EF not predefined sync 0-F
$F0-$FC reserved for future use
$FD     audio end (start of silence)
$FE     audio file ends
$FF     one more byte of events follows (all the following bytes with the value $FF have the same function)
```

不需要终止诸如“intro start”之类的启动事件。'Not predefined sync's ($E0-EF)用于用户事件。你可能想要同步你的音乐到一些东西，如设置在舞台上的explosion，打开你的屏幕保护程序等。

每个标签中可能只有一个“ETCO”帧。

## 4.7. MPEG location lookup table

为了提高MPEG音频文件中跳跃的性能和准确性，在文件中不同位置具有时间码的帧可能很有用。ID3v2帧包含软件可以使用的引用去计算文件中的位置。在帧头之后是一个描述符，表示每次引用时'frame counter'应该增加多少。如果这个值是2，那么第一个参考点指向第二帧，第二个参考点指向第四帧，第三个参考点指向第六帧，以此类推。以类似的方式，“引用之间的字节”和“引用之间的毫秒”分别指出字节和毫秒。

每个引用由两部分组成;一定数量的比特，定义为“比特字节偏差”，描述了“引用之间的字节”与现实之间的差异，以及一定数量的比特，定义为“比特毫秒偏差”，描述了“引用之间的毫秒”与现实之间的差异。每个引用中的比特数，即。'字节偏移位'+'毫秒偏移位'，必须是4的倍数。每个标签中可能只有一个“MLLT”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Location lookup table', ID: "MLLT">
MPEG frames between reference   $xx xx
Bytes between reference         $xx xx xx
Milliseconds between reference  $xx xx xx
Bits for bytes deviation        $xx
Bits for milliseconds dev.      $xx
```

然后，对于每一个引用包括以下数据;

```c++
Deviation in bytes         %xxx....
Deviation in milliseconds  %xxx....
```

## 4.8. Synchronised tempo codes

为了更准确地描述音乐作品的节奏，可以使用这个frame。在报头后面跟着一个字节，描述应该使用哪种时间戳格式。然后遵循一个或多个节奏代码。每个节拍码由一个节拍部分和一个拍子部分组成。节拍是用一个或两个字节描述的BPM。如果第一个字节的值为\$FF，那么后面会有一个字节，它会被添加到第一个字节，给出2 - 510 BPM的范围，因为\$00和\$01是保留的。\$00用于描述无节拍的时间段，这与无音乐的时间段不同。$01用来表示一个单拍，后面跟着一个无拍的周期。

节奏描述符后面跟着一个时间戳。每当音乐的节奏发生变化时，节奏描述符就会向player表明这一点。所有节奏描述符都应该按照时间顺序排列。在一个时间段内的第一个beat-stroke与节拍描述发生在同一时间。每个标签中可能只有一个“SYTC”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Synchronised tempo codes', ID: "SYTC">
Time stamp format    $xx
Tempo data           <binary data>
```

其中时间戳格式为:

```c++
$01 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
$02 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
```

Absolute time意味着每个戳包含从文件开始的时间。

## 4.9. Unsychronised lyrics/text transcription

该frame包含歌曲的歌词或其他声乐活动的文本转录。头包括编码描述符和内容描述符。正文由实际文本组成。“内容描述符”是一个终止字符串。如果没有输入描述符，“内容描述符”仅为$00(00)。文本中允许使用换行符。每个标签中可能有多个“Unsychronised lyrics/text transcription”帧，但只有一个具有相同的语言和内容描述符。

```c++
<Header for 'Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription', ID: "USLT">
Text encoding       $xx
Language            $xx xx xx
Content descriptor  <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
Lyrics/text         <full text string according to encoding>
```

## 4.10. Synchronised lyrics/text

这是另一种将所说或唱的歌词作为文本合并到音频文件中的方法，不过这次要与音频同步。它也可以用来描述发生在舞台上或与音频同步的屏幕上的事件。报头包含一个内容描述符，用终止文本字符串表示。如果没有输入描述符， 'Content descriptor' 仅为$00(00)。

```c++
<Header for 'Synchronised lyrics/text', ID: "SYLT">
Text encoding       $xx
Language            $xx xx xx
Time stamp format   $xx
Content type        $xx
Content descriptor  <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
```

Encoding:

```c++
$00     ISO-8859-1 character set is used => $00 is sync identifier.
$01     Unicode character set is used => $00 00 is sync identifier.
```

Content type:

```c++
$00     is other
$01     is lyrics
$02     is text transcription
$03     is movement/part name (e.g. "Adagio")
$04     is events (e.g. "Don Quijote enters the stage")
$05     is chord (e.g. "Bb F Fsus")
$06     is trivia/'pop up' information
```

时间戳格式为:

```c++
$01 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
$02 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
see 4.7. MPEG location lookup table
```

Absolute time意味着每个戳包含从文件开始的时间。

帧头后面的文本与 unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription 在一个主要方面有所不同。每个音节(或编码器认为方便的任何文本大小)都是一个以空结尾的字符串，后面跟着一个时间戳，表示它在声音文件中的位置。因此，每个同步都有以下结构:

```c++
Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)
Sync identifier (terminator to above string)    $00 (00)
Time stamp      $xx (xx ...)
```

“Time stamp”被设置为零，如果直接位于声音的开头，整个同步将被省略。所有时间戳都应该按时间顺序排序。同步可以被认为是后续字符串的验证器。

换行符(\$0A)允许出现在所有的“SYLT”帧中，并且应该在内容类型为\$03 - \$04的帧中的每个条目(名称，事件等)之后使用。

关于空格字符的一些注意事项:分隔单词的空格应该标记新单词的开始，因此出现在新单词的第一个音节之前。这对换行字符也是有效的。后面有逗号的音节不应该用同步音分开(音节和逗号都应该在同步音之前)。

一个例子:“USLT”段落

```c++
"Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"
```

将“SYLT”编码为:

```c++
"Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 
xx xx " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx 
"ing" $00 xx xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx
```

每个标记中可能有多个“SYLT”帧，但只有一个具有相同的语言和内容描述符。

## 4.11. Comments

此frame用于不适合任何其他框架的任何类型的全文信息。它由一个帧头组成，后面跟着编码、语言和内容描述符，并以实际的注释作为文本字符串结束。注释文本字符串中允许使用换行符。每个标记中可能有多个注释帧，但只有一个具有相同的语言和内容描述符。

```c++
<Header for 'Comment', ID: "COMM">
Text encoding           $xx
Language                $xx xx xx
Short content descrip.  <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
The actual text         <full text string according to encoding>
```

## 4.12. Relative volume adjustment

这是一个比前面的function 更主观的function 。它允许用户在播放文件时说出他想在每个通道上增加/减少多少音量。目的是能够将所有文件对齐到一个参考卷，这样您就不必不断地更改卷。这个框架也可以用来平衡调整音频。如果音量峰值水平已知，则可以用'Peak volume right' and 'Peak volume left' field进行描述。如果不知道峰值音量，这些字段可以保留为零，如果没有其他数据，则完全省略。每个标签中可能只有一个“RVAD”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Relative volume adjustment', ID: "RVAD">
Increment/decrement             %00xxxxxx
Bits used for volume descr.     $xx
Relative volume change, right   $xx xx (xx ...)
Relative volume change, left    $xx xx (xx ...)
Peak volume right               $xx xx (xx ...)
Peak volume left                $xx xx (xx ...)
```

在自增/自减字段中，位0用于表示右通道，位1用于表示左通道。1是递增，0是递减。

对于MPEG 2 layer I、II、III和MPEG 2.5，'bits used for volume description' field 通常\$10(16位)。这个值可能不是$00。卷总是用整个字节表示，当 'bits used for volume description' 不是8的倍数时，在开头填充(最高位)。

这个数据锁后面可选地跟着left and right back channels的卷定义。如果这个信息被追加到帧，前两个通道将被视为前通道。在自增/自减字段中，位2用于表示右返回信道，位3用于表示the left back channel.

```c++
Relative volume change, right back      $xx xx (xx ...)
Relative volume change, left back       $xx xx (xx ...)
Peak volume right back                  $xx xx (xx ...)
Peak volume left back                   $xx xx (xx ...)
```

如果出现了中心通道调整，则在左后通道和右后通道之后追加以下内容到现有帧。中心信道由增加/减少字段中的第4位表示。

```c++
Relative volume change, center  $xx xx (xx ...)
Peak volume center              $xx xx (xx ...)
```

如果存在低音通道调整，则在中心通道之后追加以下内容到现有帧。低音信道由增加/减少字段中的第5位表示。

```c++
Relative volume change, bass    $xx xx (xx ...)
Peak volume bass                $xx xx (xx ...)
```

## 4.13. Equalisation(均衡)

这是另一个主观的、对齐的frame。它允许用户在音频文件中预先定义均衡曲线。每个标签中可能只有一个“EQUA”帧。

```c++
<Header of 'Equalisation', ID: "EQUA">
Adjustment bits $xx
```

 'adjustment bits' field 定义了用于表示调整的位数。这通常是\$10(16位)的MPEG 2 layer I, II和III和MPEG 2.5。这个值可能不是$00。

接下来是2个字节+('adjustment bits'四舍到最近的字节)，为以下格式的每个均衡频带，给出0 - 32767Hz的频率范围:

```c++
Increment/decrement     %x (MSB of the Frequency)
Frequency               (lower 15 bits)
Adjustment              $xx (xx ...)
```

递增/递减位为1表示递增，0表示递减。均衡频带应根据频率逐渐有序。所有频率都不需要声明。读取软件中的均衡曲线应该在这一帧的值之间进行插值。三个相等的调整三个后续频率。一个频率在坐标系中应该只描述一次。

## 4.14. Reverb(混响)

这又是一个主观问题。你可以在这里调整不同种类的回声。左/右混响是ms中每次反弹之间的延迟。左/右混响是应该进行的反弹次数。\$FF等于无限次的反弹。反馈是应返回给下一次回声反弹的音量量。\$00是0% \$FF是100%如果该值为$7F，则第一次反弹的成交量将减少50%，第二次反弹的成交量将减少50%，以此类推。从左到左表示从左弹跳发出的声音将在左侧扬声器中播放，而从左到右表示从左弹跳发出的声音将在右侧扬声器中播放。

“从左到右预混”是在应用任何混响之前，将左侧声音混合到右侧的量，其中\$00 id为0%，\$FF为100%。“从右向左预混”做同样的事情，但从右向左。将两个预混滤波器都设置为$FF将导致单声道输出(如果混响是对称应用的)。每个标签中可能只有一个“RVRB”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Reverb', ID: "RVRB">
Reverb left (ms)                $xx xx
Reverb right (ms)               $xx xx
Reverb bounces, left            $xx
Reverb bounces, right           $xx
Reverb feedback, left to left   $xx
Reverb feedback, left to right  $xx
Reverb feedback, right to right $xx
Reverb feedback, right to left  $xx
Premix left to right            $xx
Premix right to left            $xx
```

## 4.15. Attached picture

此frame包含与音频文件直接相关的图片。图像格式是MIME类型和Image的子类型。在省略MIME媒体类型名称的情况下，将隐含“image/”。当需要互操作性时，应使用“image/png”或“image/jpeg”图片格式。描述是对图片的简短描述，表示为终止的文本字符串。描述的最大长度为64个字符，但可以为空。一个文件中可能有多张图片，每张图片都在各自的“APIC”框架中，但只有一张图片具有相同的内容描述符。可能只有一张图片类型分别声明为图片类型\$01和$02。有可能通过使用“MIME类型”“——&gt;”只放一个图像文件的链接，并有一个完整的URL而不是图片数据。但是，应谨慎使用链接文件，因为存在文件分离的风险。

```c++
<Header for 'Attached picture', ID: "APIC">
Text encoding   $xx
MIME type       <text string> $00
Picture type    $xx
Description     <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
Picture data    <binary data>
```

图片类型：

```c++
$00     Other
$01     32x32 pixels 'file icon' (PNG only)
$02     Other file icon
$03     Cover (front)
$04     Cover (back)
$05     Leaflet page
$06     Media (e.g. lable side of CD)
$07     Lead artist/lead performer/soloist
$08     Artist/performer
$09     Conductor
$0A     Band/Orchestra
$0B     Composer
$0C     Lyricist/text writer
$0D     Recording Location
$0E     During recording
$0F     During performance
$10     Movie/video screen capture
$11     A bright coloured fish
$12     Illustration
$13     Band/artist logotype
$14     Publisher/Studio logotype
```

## 4.16. General encapsulated object

在这个frame中，任何类型的文件都可以被封装。在报头之后，'Frame size'和'Encoding'紧跟'MIME type'，表示为用ISO-8859-1编码的终止字符串。文件名区分大小写，编码为'Encoding'。然后，内容描述为终止字符串，编码为'Encoding'。框架中的最后一个东西是实际的对象。前两个字符串可以省略，只留下它们的结尾。每个标记中可能有多个“GEOB”帧，但只有一个具有相同的内容描述符。

```c++
<Header for 'General encapsulated object', ID: "GEOB">
Text encoding           $xx
MIME type               <text string> $00
Filename                <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
Content description     $00 (00)
Encapsulated object     <binary data>
```

## 4.17. Play counter

这只是一个文件被播放次数的计数器。该值在每次文件开始播放时加1。每个标签中可能只有一个“PCNT”帧。当计数器达到1时，在计数器前面插入一个字节，从而使计数器变大8位。计数器必须至少有32位。

```c++
<Header for 'Play counter', ID: "PCNT">
Counter         $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)
```

## 4.18. Popularimeter

这个帧的目的是指定音频文件有多好。很多有趣的应用都可以在这个frame中找到，比如播放列表，播放列表中有更多更好的音频文件，或者它可以用来分析一个人的品味，通过比较人们的配置文件来找到其他“好”文件。框架非常简单。它包含发送给用户的电子邮件地址、一个评级字节和一个四字节播放计数器，每次播放文件都会增加一个。电子邮件是一个终止的字符串。评分是1-255，其中1是最差的，255是最好的。0是未知数。如果不需要personal counter，可以省略。当计数器达到所有1时，在计数器前面插入一个字节，从而使计数器在与播放计数器(“PCNT”)相同的距离内大8位。每个标签中可能有多个“POPM”帧，但只有一个具有相同的电子邮件地址。

```c++
<Header for 'Popularimeter', ID: "POPM">
Email to user   <text string> $00
Rating          $xx
Counter         $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)
```

## 4.19. Recommended buffer size

有时，发送音频文件的服务器意识到传输或编码问题导致音频流中断。在这些情况下，服务器可以使用这个框架来推荐缓冲区的大小。如果'embedded info flag'为true(1)，那么这表明'Buffer size'中描述的最大大小的ID3标记可能出现在audio stream中。在这种情况下，如果音频是MPEG编码的，则标记应该位于两个MPEG帧之间。如果下一个标签的位置已知，则可以使用'offset to next tag'。偏移量是从该帧所在标签的结束到下一帧标头的第一个字节。这个字段可以省略。通常不建议使用嵌入式标签，因为这可能会导致当前软件/硬件无法预测的行为。

对于像流式音频这样的应用程序，将标签嵌入到音频流中可能是一个好主意。如果客户端连接到像HTTP这样的单独连接，并且有可能以一个标记开始每一次传输，那么这个标记应该包括一个'recommended buffer size' frame。如果客户端连接到流中的任意点，比如无线电或多播，那么每个标签中都应该包含'recommended buffer size' frame。在初始/第一个标记之后拾取的每个标记都被认为是前一个标记的更新。例如，如果在第一个接收到的标签中有一个“TIT2”帧，在第二个标签中也有一个，那么第一个应该被第二个“替换”。

“Buffer size”应该保持最小值。每个标签中可能只有一个“RBUF”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Recommended buffer size', ID: "RBUF">
Buffer size             $xx xx xx
Embedded info flag      %0000000x
Offset to next tag      $xx xx xx xx
```

## 4.20. Audio encryption(音频加密)

这个帧表示实际的音频流是否被加密，以及由谁加密。由于这种加密方案的标准化超出了本文档的范围，所有“AENC”帧都以一个包含电子邮件地址的URL结尾的字符串开始，或者是一个指向可以找到电子邮件地址的位置的链接，这属于负责此特定加密音频文件的组织。有关加密音频的问题应发送到指定的电子邮件地址。如果在“帧大小”后面直接找到$00，并且音频文件确实是加密的，那么整个文件可能被认为是无用的。

在'Owner identifier'之后，可以指定指向音频未加密部分的指针。'Owner identifier'(“预览开始”)和'Preview length'(“预览长度”)是以帧为单位描述的。如果没有未加密的部分，这些字段应该保留为零。在'Preview length'() “预览长度”)字段之后，可选地跟随音频解密所需的数据锁。标签中可能有多个“AENC”帧，但只有一个具有相同的 'Owner identifier'.

```c++
<Header for 'Audio encryption', ID: "AENC">
Owner identifier        <text string> $00
Preview start           $xx xx
Preview length          $xx xx
Encryption info         <binary data>
```

## 4.21. Linked information

为了尽可能减少空间浪费，可以使用此帧链接来自另一个ID3v2标签的信息，这些ID3v2标签可能位于另一个音频文件中，也可能单独位于二进制文件中。建议仅在文件存储在CD-ROM或其他文件分离风险较低的情况下使用此方法。帧包含一个帧标识符(应该链接到这个标记中的帧)，一个URL字段(给出帧所在文件的引用)，以及额外的ID数据(如果需要的话)。应该从该链接指向的文件中找到的第一个标记检索数据。一个标签中可能有多个“LINK”帧，但只有一个具有相同的内容。链接帧被认为是标签的一部分，并具有与标签的物理部分相同的限制(即只允许一个“RVRB”帧，无论是否链接)。

```c++
<Header for 'Linked information', ID: "LINK">
Frame identifier        $xx xx xx
URL                     <text string> $00
ID and additional data  <text string(s)>
```

可以被链接且不需要额外数据的帧有“IPLS”、“MCID”、“ETCO”、“MLLT”、“SYTC”、“RVAD”、“EQUA”、“RVRB”、“RBUF”、文本信息帧和URL链接帧。

“TXXX”、“APIC”、“GEOB”和“AENC”帧可以作为附加ID数据与内容描述符链接。

“COMM”，“SYLT”和“USLT”帧可以与三个字节的语言描述符直接链接，后面跟着一个内容描述符作为额外的ID数据。

## 4.22. Position synchronisation frame

这个帧 向侦听器传递了他获得音频流到多远的信息;实际上，它声明了流中第一帧的时间偏移。框架布局为:

```c++
<Head for 'Position synchronisation', ID: "POSS">
Time stamp format   $xx
Position            $xx (xx ...)
```

其中时间戳格式为:

```c++
$01 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
$02 Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit
```

并且位置是听者开始接收音频的位置，即下一帧的开始。如果该帧用于文件的开头，则该值始终为0。每个标签中可能只有一个“POSS”帧。

## 4.23. Terms of use frame

这个frame包含了对文件的使用条款和所有权的简要描述。关于法律条款的更详细资料可通过“WCOP”框架获得。文本中允许换行。一个标签中可能只有一个“USER”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Terms of use frame', ID: "USER">
Text encoding   $xx
Language        $xx xx xx
The actual text <text string according to encoding>
```

## 4.24. Ownership frame

Ownership frame可以用作已完成交易的提醒，如果已签名，则用作证明。注意，“USER”和“TOWN”框架很适合与这个框架结合使用。帧开始，在帧ID，大小和编码字段之后，有一个'price paid '字段。此字段的前三个字符包含用于交易的货币，根据ISO-4217字母货币代码进行编码。与此连接的是实际支付的价格，作为使用“.”作为小数分隔符的数字字符串。接下来是一个8个字符的日期字符串(YYYYMMDD)，后面是一个字符串，该字符串的最后一个字段是卖家的名字。一个标签中可能只有一个“OWNE”帧。

```c++
<Header for 'Ownership frame', ID: "OWNE">
Text encoding   $xx
Price payed     <text string> $00
Date of purch.  <text string>
Seller          <text string according to encoding>
```

## 4.25. Commercial frame

这个frame通过捆绑所有需要的信息，在同一个标签中支持多个相互竞争的报价。这使得这个框架相当复杂，但这是一个更简单的解决方案，如果一个人试图实现相同的结果与几个框架。帧开始于帧ID、大小和编码字段之后，是一个价格字符串字段。价格由一个三个字符的货币代码构成，该代码根据ISO-4217字母货币代码编码，后面跟着一个数字，其中“.”用作小数分隔符。在价格字符串中，几个价格可以连接在一起，用“/”字符分隔，但每种类型可能只有一种货币。

价格字符串后面是一个YYYYMMDD格式的8个字符的日期字符串，描述价格的有效期。在这之后是一个联系URL，用户可以通过它联系卖家，后面是一个字节的“received as”字段。它描述了音频是如何根据以下列表购买的:

```c++
$00     Other
$01     Standard CD album with other songs
$02     Compressed audio on CD
$03     File over the Internet
$04     Stream over the Internet
$05     As note sheets
$06     As note sheets in a book with other sheets
$07     Music on other media
$08     Non-musical merchandise
```

接下来是一个带有卖家名称的终止字符串，后面是一个带有简短产品描述的终止字符串。最后一件事是包含公司标志的能力。第一个是'Picture MIME type' field，包含使用哪种图片格式的信息。在省略MIME媒体类型名称的情况下，将隐含“image/”。目前只允许“image/png”和“image/jpeg”。该格式字符串后面是二进制图片数据。如果要附加无图，最后两个字段可以省略。

```c++
<Header for 'Commercial frame', ID: "COMR">
Text encoding     $xx
Price string      <text string> $00
Valid until       <text string>
Contact URL       <text string> $00
Received as       $xx
Name of seller    <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
Description       <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
Picture MIME type <string> $00
Seller logo       <binary data>
```

## 4.26. Encryption method registration

要识别一个帧是用哪种方法加密的，加密方法必须注册在该帧的标记中。 'Owner identifier' 是一个以空结尾的字符串，包含一个包含电子邮件地址的URL，或一个指向可以找到电子邮件地址的位置的链接，属于负责这种特定加密方法的组织。有关加密方法的问题应发送到指定的电子邮件地址。Method symbol'在整个标签中包含一个与该方法相关联的值。低于$80的值将被保留。Method symbol'后面可选地跟加密的特定数据。在一个标签中可能有几个“ENCR”帧，但只有一个包含相同的符号，只有一个包含相同的所有者标识符。该方法必须在标记中的某个地方使用。更多信息请参见第3.3.1节，标志j。

```c++
<Header for 'Encryption method registration', ID: "ENCR">
Owner identifier    <text string> $00
Method symbol       $xx
Encryption data     <binary data>
```

## 4.27. Group identification registration

这个帧可以对其他不相关的帧进行分组。当需要对某些帧进行签名时，可以使用这个选项。为了识别哪些帧属于一组帧，必须在该帧的标签中注册一个组标识符。'Owner identifier' 是一个以空结尾的字符串，包含一个包含电子邮件地址的URL，或一个指向可以找到电子邮件地址的位置的链接，属于负责分组的组织。有关分组的问题应发送到指定的电子邮件地址。 'Group symbol' 包含一个值，在整个标签中将帧与该组关联起来。低于$80的值将被保留。 'Group symbol' 后面可选择跟随一些组特定的数据，例如数字签名。一个标签中可能有几个“GRID”帧，但只有一个包含相同的符号，只有一个包含相同的所有者标识符。组符号必须在标记中的某处使用。更多信息请参见第3.3.1节，标志j。

```c++
<Header for 'Group ID registration', ID: "GRID">
Owner identifier     <text string> $00
Group symbol         $xx
Group dependent data <binary data>
```

## 4.28. Private frame

该frame用于包含来自软件生产者的信息，该软件生产者的程序使用这些信息，而不适合其他框架。帧由'Owner identifier'字符串和二进制数据组成。'Owner identifier' 是一个以空结束的字符串，包含一个URL，其中包含一个电子邮件地址，或一个链接到一个可以找到电子邮件地址的位置，该位置属于负责该帧的组织。有关框架的问题应发送到指定的电子邮件地址。标签可以包含多个“PRIV”帧，但内容不同。建议保持尽可能低的“PRIV”帧数。

```c++
<Header for 'Private frame', ID: "PRIV">
Owner identifier        <text string> $00
The private data        <binary data>
```

# 5. The unsynchronisation scheme

'unsynchronisation scheme' 的唯一目的是使ID3v2标签尽可能与现有软件兼容。如果文件只是要由新软件处理，那么'unsynchronisation scheme' 标记是没有用的。不同步只能与MPEG 2 layer I, II和III以及MPEG 2.5文件进行。

每当在标记中发现一个 false synchronisation时，在第一个 false synchronisation字节之后插入一个零字节。ID3编码器应该修改的正确同步格式如下:

```c++
%11111111 111xxxxx
```

并应替换为:

```c++
%11111111 00000000 111xxxxx
```

这有一个副作用，所有\$FF 00组合都必须被改变，所以它们不会受到解码过程的影响。因此，在不同步期间，所有的\$FF 00组合必须被$FF 00 00组合替换。

为了指示不同步的使用，应该设置'ID3 flags' 中的第一个位。只有当标签包含一个false synchronisation时，才应该设置这个位。只有当标签不包含任何false synchronisations时，这个bit应当被清除。

请记住，如果编码器使用了压缩方案，那么不同步方案应该在*之后*应用。当解码一个压缩的'unsynchronised'文件时，应该先解析'unsynchronisation scheme'，然后解压缩。

如果标签中的最后一个字节是$FF，并且需要消除标签中的错误同步，那么至少应该添加一个字节的填充。

Informal standard                                             M. Nilsson
Document: id3v2.3.0.txt                                3rd February 1999


                           ID3 tag version 2.3.0

Status of this document

   This document is an informal standard and replaces the ID3v2.2.0
   standard [ID3v2]. The informal standard is released so that
   implementors could have a set standard before a formal standard is
   set. The formal standard will use another version or revision number
   if not identical to what is described in this document. The contents
   in this document may change for clarifications but never for added or
   altered functionallity.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.


Abstract

   This document describes the ID3v2.3.0, which is a more developed
   version of the ID3v2 informal standard [ID3v2] (version 2.2.0),
   evolved from the ID3 tagging system. The ID3v2 offers a flexible way
   of storing information about an audio file within itself to determine
   its origin and contents. The information may be technical
   information, such as equalisation curves, as well as related meta
   information, such as title, performer, copyright etc.

2.   Conventions in this document

   In the examples, text within "" is a text string exactly as it
   appears in a file. Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and
   numbers preceded with % are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte
   with unknown content. %x is used to indicate a bit with unknown
   content. The most significant bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7'
   and the least significant bit (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.

   A tag is the whole tag described in this document. A frame is a block
   of information in the tag. The tag consists of a header, frames and
   optional padding. A field is a piece of information; one value, a
   string etc. A numeric string is a string that consists of the
   characters 0-9 only.


3.   ID3v2 overview

   The two biggest design goals were to be able to implement ID3v2
   without disturbing old software too much and that ID3v2 should be
   as flexible and expandable as possible.

   The first criterion is met by the simple fact that the MPEG [MPEG]
   decoding software uses a syncsignal, embedded in the audiostream, to
   'lock on to' the audio. Since the ID3v2 tag doesn't contain a valid
   syncsignal, no software will attempt to play the tag. If, for any
   reason, coincidence make a syncsignal appear within the tag it will
   be taken care of by the 'unsynchronisation scheme' described in
   section 5.

   The second criterion has made a more noticeable impact on the design
   of the ID3v2 tag. It is constructed as a container for several
   information blocks, called frames, whose format need not be known to
   the software that encounters them. At the start of every frame there
   is an identifier that explains the frames' format and content, and a
   size descriptor that allows software to skip unknown frames.

   If a total revision of the ID3v2 tag should be needed, there is a
   version number and a size descriptor in the ID3v2 header.

   The ID3 tag described in this document is mainly targeted at files
   encoded with MPEG-1/2 layer I, MPEG-1/2 layer II, MPEG-1/2 layer III
   and MPEG-2.5, but may work with other types of encoded audio.

   The bitorder in ID3v2 is most significant bit first (MSB). The
   byteorder in multibyte numbers is most significant byte first (e.g.
   $12345678 would be encoded $12 34 56 78).

   It is permitted to include padding after all the final frame (at the
   end of the ID3 tag), making the size of all the frames together
   smaller than the size given in the head of the tag. A possible
   purpose of this padding is to allow for adding a few additional
   frames or enlarge existing frames within the tag without having to
   rewrite the entire file. The value of the padding bytes must be $00.


3.1.   ID3v2 header

   The ID3v2 tag header, which should be the first information in the
   file, is 10 bytes as follows:

     ID3v2/file identifier      "ID3"
     ID3v2 version              $03 00
     ID3v2 flags                %abc00000
     ID3v2 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx

   The first three bytes of the tag are always "ID3" to indicate that
   this is an ID3v2 tag, directly followed by the two version bytes. The
   first byte of ID3v2 version is it's major version, while the second
   byte is its revision number. In this case this is ID3v2.3.0. All
   revisions are backwards compatible while major versions are not. If
   software with ID3v2.2.0 and below support should encounter version
   three or higher it should simply ignore the whole tag. Version and
   revision will never be $FF.

   The version is followed by one the ID3v2 flags field, of which
   currently only three flags are used.


   a - Unsynchronisation

     Bit 7 in the 'ID3v2 flags' indicates whether or not
     unsynchronisation is used (see section 5 for details); a set bit
     indicates usage.


   b - Extended header

     The second bit (bit 6) indicates whether or not the header is
     followed by an extended header. The extended header is described in
     section 3.2.


   c - Experimental indicator

     The third bit (bit 5) should be used as an 'experimental
     indicator'. This flag should always be set when the tag is in an
     experimental stage.

   All the other flags should be cleared. If one of these undefined
   flags are set that might mean that the tag is not readable for a
   parser that does not know the flags function.

   The ID3v2 tag size is encoded with four bytes where the most
   significant bit (bit 7) is set to zero in every byte, making a total
   of 28 bits. The zeroed bits are ignored, so a 257 bytes long tag is
   represented as $00 00 02 01.

   The ID3v2 tag size is the size of the complete tag after
   unsychronisation, including padding, excluding the header but not
   excluding the extended header (total tag size - 10). Only 28 bits
   (representing up to 256MB) are used in the size description to avoid
   the introducuction of 'false syncsignals'.

   An ID3v2 tag can be detected with the following pattern:
     $49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
   Where yy is less than $FF, xx is the 'flags' byte and zz is less than
   $80.


3.2.   ID3v2 extended header

   The extended header contains information that is not vital to the
   correct parsing of the tag information, hence the extended header is
   optional.
         扩展头包含的信息对于正确解析标记信息并不重要，因此扩展头是可选的。

     Extended header size   $xx xx xx xx
     Extended Flags         $xx xx
     Size of padding        $xx xx xx xx

   Where the 'Extended header size', currently 6 or 10 bytes, excludes
   itself. The 'Size of padding' is simply the total tag size excluding
   the frames and the headers, in other words the padding. The extended
   header is considered separate from the header proper, and as such is
   subject to unsynchronisation.
         其中'扩展头大小'，目前6或10字节，不包括自己。“填充的大小”只是总的标签大小，不包括帧和报头，换句话说就是填充。扩展头被认为与头本身是分开的，因此受到不同步的影响。

   The extended flags are a secondary flag set which describes further
   attributes of the tag. These attributes are currently defined as
   follows

     %x0000000 00000000


   x - CRC data present

     If this flag is set four bytes of CRC-32 data is appended to the
     extended header. The CRC should be calculated before
     unsynchronisation on the data between the extended header and the
     padding, i.e. the frames and only the frames.
         如果设置了这个标志，就会有四个字节的CRC-32数据被追加到扩展头中。CRC应该在扩展报头和填充之间的数据不同步之前计算，即帧和仅帧。

        Total frame CRC        $xx xx xx xx


3.3.   ID3v2 frame overview

   As the tag consists of a tag header and a tag body with one or more
   frames, all the frames consists of a frame header followed by one or
   more fields containing the actual information. The layout of the
   frame header:

     Frame ID   $xx xx xx xx  (four characters)
     Size       $xx xx xx xx
     Flags      $xx xx

   The frame ID made out of the characters capital A-Z and 0-9.
   Identifiers beginning with "X", "Y" and "Z" are for experimental use
   and free for everyone to use, without the need to set the
   experimental bit in the tag header. Have in mind that someone else
   might have used the same identifier as you. All other identifiers are
   either used or reserved for future use.

   The frame ID is followed by a size descriptor, making a total header
   size of ten bytes in every frame. The size is calculated as frame
   size excluding frame header (frame size - 10).

   In the frame header the size descriptor is followed by two flags
   bytes. These flags are described in section 3.3.1.

   There is no fixed order of the frames' appearance in the tag,
   although it is desired that the frames are arranged in order of
   significance concerning the recognition of the file. An example of
   such order: UFID, TIT2, MCDI, TRCK ...

   A tag must contain at least one frame. A frame must be at least 1
   byte big, excluding the header.

   If nothing else is said a string is represented as ISO-8859-1
   [ISO-8859-1] characters in the range $20 - $FF. Such strings are
   represented as <text string>, or <full text string> if newlines are
   allowed, in the frame descriptions. All Unicode strings [UNICODE] use
   16-bit unicode 2.0 (ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993, UCS-2). Unicode strings
   must begin with the Unicode BOM ($FF FE or $FE FF) to identify the
   byte order.

   All numeric strings and URLs [URL] are always encoded as ISO-8859-1.
   Terminated strings are terminated with $00 if encoded with ISO-8859-1
   and $00 00 if encoded as unicode. If nothing else is said newline
   character is forbidden. In ISO-8859-1 a new line is represented, when
   allowed, with $0A only. Frames that allow different types of text
   encoding have a text encoding description byte directly after the
   frame size. If ISO-8859-1 is used this byte should be $00, if Unicode
   is used it should be $01. Strings dependent on encoding is
   represented as <text string according to encoding>, or <full text
   string according to encoding> if newlines are allowed.  Any empty
   Unicode strings which are NULL-terminated may have the Unicode BOM
   followed by a Unicode NULL ($FF FE 00 00 or $FE FF 00 00).

   The three byte language field is used to describe the language of the
   frame's content, according to ISO-639-2 [ISO-639-2].

   All URLs [URL] may be relative, e.g. "picture.png", "../doc.txt".

   If a frame is longer than it should be, e.g. having more fields than
   specified in this document, that indicates that additions to the
   frame have been made in a later version of the ID3v2 standard. This
   is reflected by the revision number in the header of the tag.


3.3.1.   Frame header flags

   In the frame header the size descriptor is followed by two flags
   bytes. All unused flags must be cleared. The first byte is for
   'status messages' and the second byte is for encoding purposes. If an
   unknown flag is set in the first byte the frame may not be changed
   without the bit cleared. If an unknown flag is set in the second byte
   it is likely to not be readable. The flags field is defined as
   follows.

     %abc00000 %ijk00000


   a - Tag alter preservation

     This flag tells the software what to do with this frame if it is
     unknown and the tag is altered in any way. This applies to all
     kinds of alterations, including adding more padding and reordering
     the frames.

     0     Frame should be preserved.
     1     Frame should be discarded.


   b - File alter preservation

     This flag tells the software what to do with this frame if it is
     unknown and the file, excluding the tag, is altered. This does not
     apply when the audio is completely replaced with other audio data.

     0     Frame should be preserved.
     1     Frame should be discarded.


   c - Read only

      This flag, if set, tells the software that the contents of this
      frame is intended to be read only. Changing the contents might
      break something, e.g. a signature. If the contents are changed,
      without knowledge in why the frame was flagged read only and
      without taking the proper means to compensate, e.g. recalculating
      the signature, the bit should be cleared.


   i - Compression

      This flag indicates whether or not the frame is compressed.

      0     Frame is not compressed.
      1     Frame is compressed using zlib [zlib] with 4 bytes for
            'decompressed size' appended to the frame header.


   j - Encryption

      This flag indicates wether or not the frame is enrypted. If set
      one byte indicating with which method it was encrypted will be
      appended to the frame header. See section 4.26. for more
      information about encryption method registration.

      0     Frame is not encrypted.
      1     Frame is encrypted.


   k - Grouping identity

      This flag indicates whether or not this frame belongs in a group
      with other frames. If set a group identifier byte is added to the
      frame header. Every frame with the same group identifier belongs
      to the same group.

      0     Frame does not contain group information
      1     Frame contains group information


   Some flags indicates that the frame header is extended with
   additional information. This information will be added to the frame
   header in the same order as the flags indicating the additions. I.e.
   the four bytes of decompressed size will preceed the encryption
   method byte. These additions to the frame header, while not included
   in the frame header size but are included in the 'frame size' field,
   are not subject to encryption or compression.


3.3.2.   Default flags

   The default settings for the frames described in this document can be
   divided into the following classes. The flags may be set differently
   if found more suitable by the software.

    1. Discarded if tag is altered, discarded if file is altered.

       None.

    2. Discarded if tag is altered, preserved if file is altered.

       None.

    3. Preserved if tag is altered, discarded if file is altered.

       AENC, ETCO, EQUA, MLLT, POSS, SYLT, SYTC, RVAD, TENC, TLEN, TSIZ

    4. Preserved if tag is altered, preserved if file is altered.

       The rest of the frames.

4.1.   Unique file identifier

   This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a
   database that may contain more information relevant to the content.
   Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all
   frames begin with a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for this specific database implementation. Questions regarding the
   database should be sent to the indicated email address. The URL
   should not be used for the actual database queries. The string
   "http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html" should be used for tests.
   Software that isn't told otherwise may safely remove such frames. The
   'Owner identifier' must be non-empty (more than just a termination).
   The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier,
   which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one "UFID" frame
   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.

     <Header for 'Unique file identifier', ID: "UFID">
     Owner identifier        <text string> $00
     Identifier              <up to 64 bytes binary data>


4.2.   Text information frames

   The text information frames are the most important frames, containing
   information like artist, album and more. There may only be one text
   information frame of its kind in an tag. If the textstring is
   followed by a termination ($00 (00)) all the following information
   should be ignored and not be displayed. All text frame identifiers
   begin with "T". Only text frame identifiers begin with "T", with the
   exception of the "TXXX" frame. All the text information frames have
   the following format:

     <Header for 'Text information frame', ID: "T000" - "TZZZ",
     excluding "TXXX" described in 4.2.2.>
     Text encoding                $xx
     Information                  <text string according to encoding>


4.2.1.   Text information frames - details

  TALB
   The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the
   recording(/source of sound) which the audio in the file is taken
   from.

  TBPM
   The 'BPM' frame contains the number of beats per minute in the
   mainpart of the audio. The BPM is an integer and represented as a
   numerical string.

  TCOM
   The 'Composer(s)' frame is intended for the name of the composer(s).
   They are seperated with the "/" character.

  TCON
   The 'Content type', which previously was stored as a one byte numeric
   value only, is now a numeric string. You may use one or several of
   the types as ID3v1.1 did or, since the category list would be
   impossible to maintain with accurate and up to date categories,
   define your own.

   References to the ID3v1 genres can be made by, as first byte, enter
   "(" followed by a number from the genres list (appendix A.) and
   ended with a ")" character. This is optionally followed by a
   refinement, e.g. "(21)" or "(4)Eurodisco". Several references can be
   made in the same frame, e.g. "(51)(39)". If the refinement should
   begin with a "(" character it should be replaced with "((", e.g. "((I
   can figure out any genre)" or "(55)((I think...)". The following new
   content types is defined in ID3v2 and is implemented in the same way
   as the numerig content types, e.g. "(RX)".

     RX  Remix
     CR  Cover

  TCOP
   The 'Copyright message' frame, which must begin with a year and a
   space character (making five characters), is intended for the
   copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file itself.
   The absence of this frame means only that the copyright information
   is unavailable or has been removed, and must not be interpreted to
   mean that the sound is public domain. Every time this field is
   displayed the field must be preceded with "Copyright " (C) " ", where
   (C) is one character showing a C in a circle.

  TDAT
   The 'Date' frame is a numeric string in the DDMM format containing
   the date for the recording. This field is always four characters
   long.

  TDLY
   The 'Playlist delay' defines the numbers of milliseconds of silence
   between every song in a playlist. The player should use the "ETC"
   frame, if present, to skip initial silence and silence at the end of
   the audio to match the 'Playlist delay' time. The time is represented
   as a numeric string.

  TENC
   The 'Encoded by' frame contains the name of the person or
   organisation that encoded the audio file. This field may contain a
   copyright message, if the audio file also is copyrighted by the
   encoder.

  TEXT
   The 'Lyricist(s)/Text writer(s)' frame is intended for the writer(s)
   of the text or lyrics in the recording. They are seperated with the
   "/" character.

  TFLT
   The 'File type' frame indicates which type of audio this tag defines.
   The following type and refinements are defined:

     MPG    MPEG Audio
       /1     MPEG 1/2 layer I
       /2     MPEG 1/2 layer II
       /3     MPEG 1/2 layer III
       /2.5   MPEG 2.5
       /AAC   Advanced audio compression
     VQF    Transform-domain Weighted Interleave Vector Quantization
     PCM    Pulse Code Modulated audio

   but other types may be used, not for these types though. This is used
   in a similar way to the predefined types in the "TMED" frame, but
   without parentheses. If this frame is not present audio type is
   assumed to be "MPG".

  TIME
   The 'Time' frame is a numeric string in the HHMM format containing
   the time for the recording. This field is always four characters
   long.

  TIT1
   The 'Content group description' frame is used if the sound belongs to
   a larger category of sounds/music. For example, classical music is
   often sorted in different musical sections (e.g. "Piano Concerto",
   "Weather - Hurricane").

  TIT2
   The 'Title/Songname/Content description' frame is the actual name of
   the piece (e.g. "Adagio", "Hurricane Donna").

  TIT3
   The 'Subtitle/Description refinement' frame is used for information
   directly related to the contents title (e.g. "Op. 16" or "Performed
   live at Wembley").

  TKEY
   The 'Initial key' frame contains the musical key in which the sound
   starts. It is represented as a string with a maximum length of three
   characters. The ground keys are represented with "A","B","C","D","E",
   "F" and "G" and halfkeys represented with "b" and "#". Minor is
   represented as "m". Example "Cbm". Off key is represented with an "o"
   only.

  TLAN
   The 'Language(s)' frame should contain the languages of the text or
   lyrics spoken or sung in the audio. The language is represented with
   three characters according to ISO-639-2. If more than one language is
   used in the text their language codes should follow according to
   their usage.

  TLEN

   The 'Length' frame contains the length of the audiofile in
   milliseconds, represented as a numeric string.

  TMED
   The 'Media type' frame describes from which media the sound
   originated. This may be a text string or a reference to the
   predefined media types found in the list below. References are made
   within "(" and ")" and are optionally followed by a text refinement,
   e.g. "(MC) with four channels". If a text refinement should begin
   with a "(" character it should be replaced with "((" in the same way
   as in the "TCO" frame. Predefined refinements is appended after the
   media type, e.g. "(CD/A)" or "(VID/PAL/VHS)".

   of a description of the string, represented as a terminated string,
   followed by the actual URL. The URL is always encoded with ISO-8859-1
   [ISO-8859-1]. There may be more than one "WXXX" frame in each tag,
   but only one with the same description.

     <Header for 'User defined URL link frame', ID: "WXXX">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Description       <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     URL               <text string>


4.4.   Involved people list

   Since there might be a lot of people contributing to an audio file in
   various ways, such as musicians and technicians, the 'Text
   information frames' are often insufficient to list everyone involved
   in a project. The 'Involved people list' is a frame containing the
   names of those involved, and how they were involved. The body simply
   contains a terminated string with the involvement directly followed
   by a terminated string with the involvee followed by a new
   involvement and so on. There may only be one "IPLS" frame in each
   tag.

     <Header for 'Involved people list', ID: "IPLS">
     Text encoding          $xx
     People list strings    <text strings according to encoding>


4.5.   Music CD identifier

   This frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD
   can be identified in databases such as the CDDB [CDDB]. The frame
   consists of a binary dump of the Table Of Contents, TOC, from the CD,
   which is a header of 4 bytes and then 8 bytes/track on the CD plus 8
   bytes for the 'lead out' making a maximum of 804 bytes. The offset to
   the beginning of every track on the CD should be described with a
   four bytes absolute CD-frame address per track, and not with absolute
   time. This frame requires a present and valid "TRCK" frame, even if
   the CD's only got one track. There may only be one "MCDI" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Music CD identifier', ID: "MCDI">
     CD TOC                <binary data>


4.6.   Event timing codes

   This frame allows synchronisation with key events in a song or sound.
   The header is:

     <Header for 'Event timing codes', ID: "ETCO">
     Time stamp format    $xx

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.

   Followed by a list of key events in the following format:

     Type of event   $xx
     Time stamp      $xx (xx ...)

   The 'Time stamp' is set to zero if directly at the beginning of the
   sound or after the previous event. All events should be sorted in
   chronological order. The type of event is as follows:

     $00  padding (has no meaning)
     $01  end of initial silence
     $02  intro start
     $03  mainpart start
     $04  outro start
     $05  outro end
     $06  verse start
     $07  refrain start
     $08  interlude start
     $09  theme start
     $0A  variation start
     $0B  key change
     $0C  time change
     $0D  momentary unwanted noise (Snap, Crackle & Pop)
     $0E  sustained noise
     $0F  sustained noise end
     $10  intro end
     $11  mainpart end
     $12  verse end
     $13  refrain end
     $14  theme end

     $15-$DF  reserved for future use

     $E0-$EF  not predefined sync 0-F

     $F0-$FC  reserved for future use

     $FD  audio end (start of silence)
     $FE  audio file ends
     $FF  one more byte of events follows (all the following bytes with
          the value $FF have the same function)

   Terminating the start events such as "intro start" is not required.
   The 'Not predefined sync's ($E0-EF) are for user events. You might
   want to synchronise your music to something, like setting of an
   explosion on-stage, turning on your screensaver etc.

   There may only be one "ETCO" frame in each tag.


4.7.   MPEG location lookup table

   To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG [MPEG]
   audio file, frames with timecodes in different locations in the file
   might be useful. The ID3v2 frame includes references that the
   software can use to calculate positions in the file. After the frame
   header is a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should
   increase for every reference. If this value is two then the first
   reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th
   frame, the 3rd reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the
   'bytes between reference' and 'milliseconds between reference' points
   out bytes and milliseconds respectively.

   Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
   defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
   between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
   a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
   deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
   'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
   in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for

   milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only
   be one "MLLT" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Location lookup table', ID: "MLLT">
     MPEG frames between reference  $xx xx
     Bytes between reference        $xx xx xx
     Milliseconds between reference $xx xx xx
     Bits for bytes deviation       $xx
     Bits for milliseconds dev.     $xx

   Then for every reference the following data is included;

     Deviation in bytes         %xxx....
     Deviation in milliseconds  %xxx....


4.8.   Synchronised tempo codes

   For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece this
   frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing
   which time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more
   tempo codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time
   part. The tempo is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the
   first byte has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added
   to the first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is
   reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time period, which is
   not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one
   single beat-stroke followed by a beat-free period.

   The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the
   tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for
   the player. All tempo descriptors should be sorted in chronological
   order. The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as
   the beat description occurs. There may only be one "SYTC" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Synchronised tempo codes', ID: "SYTC">
     Time stamp format   $xx
     Tempo data          <binary data>

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.


4.9.   Unsychronised lyrics/text transcription

   This frame contains the lyrics of the song or a text transcription of
   other vocal activities. The head includes an encoding descriptor and
   a content descriptor. The body consists of the actual text. The
   'Content descriptor' is a terminated string. If no descriptor is
   entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only. Newline characters
   are allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Unsynchronised
   lyrics/text transcription' frame in each tag, but only one with the
   same language and content descriptor.

     <Header for 'Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription', ID: "USLT">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     Content descriptor   <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Lyrics/text          <full text string according to encoding>


4.10.   Synchronised lyrics/text

   This is another way of incorporating the words, said or sung lyrics,
   in the audio file as text, this time, however, in sync with the
   audio. It might also be used to describing events e.g. occurring on a
   stage or on the screen in sync with the audio. The header includes a
   content descriptor, represented with as terminated textstring. If no
   descriptor is entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only.

     <Header for 'Synchronised lyrics/text', ID: "SYLT">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     Time stamp format    $xx
     Content type         $xx
     Content descriptor   <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)


   Encoding:   $00  ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1] character set is used => $00
                    is sync identifier.
               $01  Unicode [UNICODE] character set is used => $00 00 is
                    sync identifier.

   Content type:   $00 is other
                   $01 is lyrics
                   $02 is text transcription
                   $03 is movement/part name (e.g. "Adagio")
                   $04 is events (e.g. "Don Quijote enters the stage")
                   $05 is chord (e.g. "Bb F Fsus")
                   $06 is trivia/'pop up' information

   Time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Abolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.

   The text that follows the frame header differs from that of the
   unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription in one major way. Each
   syllable (or whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by
   the encoder) is a null terminated string followed by a time stamp
   denoting where in the sound file it belongs. Each sync thus has the
   following structure:

     Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)
     Sync identifier (terminator to above string)   $00 (00)
     Time stamp                                     $xx (xx ...)

   The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if
   located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps
   should be sorted in chronological order. The sync can be considered
   as a validator of the subsequent string.

   Newline ($0A) characters are allowed in all "SYLT" frames and should
   be used after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the
   content type $03 - $04.

   A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace
   separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus
   occurring in front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also
   valid for new line characters. A syllable followed by a comma should
   not be broken apart with a sync (both the syllable and the comma
   should be before the sync).

   An example: The "USLT" passage

     "Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"

   would be "SYLT" encoded as:

     "Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 xx xx
     " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx "ing" $00 xx
     xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx

   There may be more than one "SYLT" frame in each tag, but only one
   with the same language and content descriptor.


4.11.   Comments

   This frame is indended for any kind of full text information that
   does not fit in any other frame. It consists of a frame header
   followed by encoding, language and content descriptors and is ended
   with the actual comment as a text string. Newline characters are
   allowed in the comment text string. There may be more than one
   comment frame in each tag, but only one with the same language and
   content descriptor.

     <Header for 'Comment', ID: "COMM">
     Text encoding          $xx
     Language               $xx xx xx
     Short content descrip. <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     The actual text        <full text string according to encoding>


4.12.   Relative volume adjustment

   This is a more subjective function than the previous ones. It allows
   the user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on
   each channel while the file is played. The purpose is to be able to
   align all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to
   change the volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance
   adjust the audio. If the volume peak levels are known then this could
   be described with the 'Peak volume right' and 'Peak volume left'
   field. If Peakvolume is not known these fields could be left zeroed
   or, if no other data follows, be completely omitted. There may only
   be one "RVAD" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Relative volume adjustment', ID: "RVAD">
     Increment/decrement           %00xxxxxx
     Bits used for volume descr.   $xx
     Relative volume change, right $xx xx (xx ...)
     Relative volume change, left  $xx xx (xx ...)
     Peak volume right             $xx xx (xx ...)
     Peak volume left              $xx xx (xx ...)

   In the increment/decrement field bit 0 is used to indicate the right
   channel and bit 1 is used to indicate the left channel. 1 is
   increment and 0 is decrement.

   The 'bits used for volume description' field is normally $10 (16
   bits) for MPEG 2 layer I, II and III [MPEG] and MPEG 2.5. This value
   may not be $00. The volume is always represented with whole bytes,
   padded in the beginning (highest bits) when 'bits used for volume
   description' is not a multiple of eight.

   This datablock is then optionally followed by a volume definition for
   the left and right back channels. If this information is appended to
   the frame the first two channels will be treated as front channels.
   In the increment/decrement field bit 2 is used to indicate the right
   back channel and bit 3 for the left back channel.

     Relative volume change, right back $xx xx (xx ...)
     Relative volume change, left back  $xx xx (xx ...)
     Peak volume right back             $xx xx (xx ...)
     Peak volume left back              $xx xx (xx ...)

   If the center channel adjustment is present the following is appended
   to the existing frame, after the left and right back channels. The
   center channel is represented by bit 4 in the increase/decrease
   field.

     Relative volume change, center  $xx xx (xx ...)
     Peak volume center              $xx xx (xx ...)

   If the bass channel adjustment is present the following is appended
   to the existing frame, after the center channel. The bass channel is
   represented by bit 5 in the increase/decrease field.

     Relative volume change, bass  $xx xx (xx ...)
     Peak volume bass              $xx xx (xx ...)


4.13.   Equalisation

   This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
   predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may only
   be one "EQUA" frame in each tag.

     <Header of 'Equalisation', ID: "EQUA">
     Adjustment bits    $xx

   The 'adjustment bits' field defines the number of bits used for
   representation of the adjustment. This is normally $10 (16 bits) for
   MPEG 2 layer I, II and III [MPEG] and MPEG 2.5. This value may not be
   $00.

   This is followed by 2 bytes + ('adjustment bits' rounded up to the
   nearest byte) for every equalisation band in the following format,
   giving a frequency range of 0 - 32767Hz:

     Increment/decrement   %x (MSB of the Frequency)
     Frequency             (lower 15 bits)
     Adjustment            $xx (xx ...)

   The increment/decrement bit is 1 for increment and 0 for decrement.
   The equalisation bands should be ordered increasingly with reference
   to frequency. All frequencies don't have to be declared. The
   equalisation curve in the reading software should be interpolated
   between the values in this frame. Three equal adjustments for three
   subsequent frequencies. A frequency should only be described once in
   the frame.


4.14.   Reverb

   Yet another subjective one. You may here adjust echoes of different
   kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce in ms.
   Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should be
   made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the
   amount of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00
   is 0%, $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
   reduction on the first bounce, 50% of that on the second and so on.
   Left to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the
   left speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to
   be played in the right speaker.

   'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the
   right before any reverb is applied, where $00 id 0% and $FF is 100%.
   'Premix right to left' does the same thing, but right to left.
   Setting both premix to $FF would result in a mono output (if the
   reverb is applied symmetric). There may only be one "RVRB" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Reverb', ID: "RVRB">
     Reverb left (ms)                 $xx xx
     Reverb right (ms)                $xx xx
     Reverb bounces, left             $xx
     Reverb bounces, right            $xx
     Reverb feedback, left to left    $xx
     Reverb feedback, left to right   $xx
     Reverb feedback, right to right  $xx
     Reverb feedback, right to left   $xx
     Premix left to right             $xx
     Premix right to left             $xx


4.15.   Attached picture

   This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
   Image format is the MIME type and subtype [MIME] for the image. In
   the event that the MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be
   implied. The "image/png" [PNG] or "image/jpeg" [JFIF] picture format
   should be used when interoperability is wanted. Description is a
   short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
   textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64 characters,
   but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to one file,
   each in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the same
   content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
   type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
   possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME
   type' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
   The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there
   is the risk of separation of files.

     <Header for 'Attached picture', ID: "APIC">

                  $14  Publisher/Studio logotype


4.16.   General encapsulated object

   In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
   'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] represented as
   as a terminated string encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The
   filename is case sensitive and is encoded as 'Encoding'. Then follows
   a content description as terminated string, encoded as 'Encoding'.
   The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The first two
   strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations. MIME type is
   always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than one "GEOB"
   frame in each tag, but only one with the same content descriptor.

     <Header for 'General encapsulated object', ID: "GEOB">
     Text encoding          $xx
     MIME type              <text string> $00

     Content description    <text string according to enc�ding> $00 (00)
     Encapsulated object    <binary data>


4.17.   Play counter

   This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
   played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
   play. There may only be one "PCNT" frame in each tag. When the
   counter reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the
   counter thus making the counter eight bits bigger.  The counter must
   be at least 32-bits long to begin with.

     <Header for 'Play counter', ID: "PCNT">
     Counter        $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)


4.18.   Popularimeter

   The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
   Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
   playlist that features better audiofiles more often than others or it
   could be used to profile a person's taste and find other 'good' files
   by comparing people's profiles. The frame is very simple. It contains
   the email address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play
   counter, intended to be increased with one for every time the file is
   played. The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where
   1 is worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is
   wanted it may be omitted.  When the counter reaches all one's, one
   byte is inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter
   eight bits bigger in the same away as the play counter ("PCNT").
   There may be more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but only one
   with the same email address.

     <Header for 'Popularimeter', ID: "POPM">
     Email to user   <text string> $00
     Rating          $xx
     Counter         $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)


4.19.   Recommended buffer size

   Sometimes the server from which a audio file is streamed is aware of
   transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
   audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
   recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
   flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
   maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audiostream.
   In such case the tag should reside between two MPEG [MPEG] frames, if
   the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next tag is known,
   'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated from the
   end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of the
   header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are
   generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable
   behaviour from present software/hardware.

   For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed
   tags into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to
   individual connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin
   every transmission with a tag, then this tag should include a
   'recommended buffer size' frame. If the client is connected to a
   arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or multicast, then the
   'recommended buffer size' frame should be included in every tag.
   Every tag that is picked up after the initial/first tag is to be
   considered as an update of the previous one. E.g. if there is a
   "TIT2" frame in the first received tag and one in the second tag,
   then the first should be 'replaced' with the second.

   The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one
   "RBUF" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Recommended buffer size', ID: "RBUF">
     Buffer size               $xx xx xx
     Embedded info flag        %0000000x
     Offset to next tag        $xx xx xx xx


4.20.   Audio encryption

   This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
   whom. Since standardisation of such encrypion scheme is beyond this
   document, all "AENC" frames begin with a terminated string with a
   URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
   email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
   responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
   regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
   specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the
   audiofile indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered
   useless.

   After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the
   audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is
   described in frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should
   be left zeroed. After the 'preview length' field follows optionally a
   datablock required for decryption of the audio. There may be more
   than one "AENC" frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner
   identifier'.

     <Header for 'Audio encryption', ID: "AENC">
     Owner identifier   <text string> $00
     Preview start      $xx xx
     Preview length     $xx xx
     Encryption info    <binary data>


4.21.   Linked information

   To keep space waste as low as possible this frame may be used to link
   information from another ID3v2 tag that might reside in another audio
   file or alone in a binary file. It is recommended that this method is
   only used when the files are stored on a CD-ROM or other
   circumstances when the risk of file seperation is low. The frame
   contains a frame identifier, which is the frame that should be linked
   into this tag, a URL [URL] field, where a reference to the file where
   the frame is given, and additional ID data, if needed. Data should be
   retrieved from the first tag found in the file to which this link
   points. There may be more than one "LINK" frame in a tag, but only
   one with the same contents. A linked frame is to be considered as
   part of the tag and has the same restrictions as if it was a physical
   part of the tag (i.e. only one "RVRB" frame allowed, whether it's
   linked or not).

     <Header for 'Linked information', ID: "LINK">
     Frame identifier        $xx xx xx
     URL                     <text string> $00
     ID and additional data  <text string(s)>

   Frames that may be linked and need no additional data are "IPLS",
   "MCID", "ETCO", "MLLT", "SYTC", "RVAD", "EQUA", "RVRB", "RBUF", the
   text information frames and the URL link frames.

   The "TXXX", "APIC", "GEOB" and "AENC" frames may be linked with
   the content descriptor as additional ID data.

   The "COMM", "SYLT" and "USLT" frames may be linked with three bytes
   of language descriptor directly followed by a content descriptor as
   additional ID data.


4.22.   Position synchronisation frame

   This frame delivers information to the listener of how far into the
   audio stream he picked up; in effect, it states the time offset of
   the first frame in the stream. The frame layout is:

     <Head for 'Position synchronisation', ID: "POSS">
     Time stamp format         $xx
     Position                  $xx (xx ...)

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   and position is where in the audio the listener starts to receive,
   i.e. the beginning of the next frame. If this frame is used in the
   beginning of a file the value is always 0. There may only be one
   "POSS" frame in each tag.


4.23.   Terms of use frame

   This frame contains a brief description of the terms of use and
   ownership of the file. More detailed information concerning the legal
   terms might be available through the "WCOP" frame. Newlines are
   allowed in the text. There may only be one "USER" frame in a tag.

     <Header for 'Terms of use frame', ID: "USER">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     The actual text      <text string according to encoding>


4.24.   Ownership frame

   The ownership frame might be used as a reminder of a made transaction
   or, if signed, as proof. Note that the "USER" and "TOWN" frames are
   good to use in conjunction with this one. The frame begins, after the
   frame ID, size and encoding fields, with a 'price payed' field. The
   first three characters of this field contains the currency used for
   the transaction, encoded according to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic
   currency code. Concatenated to this is the actual price payed, as a
   numerical string using "." as the decimal separator. Next is an 8
   character date string (YYYYMMDD) followed by a string with the name
   of the seller as the last field in the frame. There may only be one
   "OWNE" frame in a tag.

     <Header for 'Ownership frame', ID: "OWNE">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Price payed       <text string> $00
     Date of purch.    <text string>
     Seller            <text string according to encoding>


4.25.   Commercial frame

   This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by
   bundling all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex
   but it's an easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same
   result with several frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID,
   size and encoding fields, with a price string field. A price is
   constructed by one three character currency code, encoded according
   to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic currency code, followed by a
   numerical value where "." is used as decimal seperator. In the price
   string several prices may be concatenated, seperated by a "/"
   character, but there may only be one currency of each type.

   The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the
   format YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After
   that is a contact URL, with which the user can contact the seller,
   followed by a one byte 'received as' field. It describes how the
   audio is delivered when bought according to the following list:

        $00  Other
        $01  Standard CD album with other songs
        $02  Compressed audio on CD
        $03  File over the Internet
        $04  Stream over the Internet
        $05  As note sheets
        $06  As note sheets in a book with other sheets
        $07  Music on other media
        $08  Non-musical merchandise

   Next follows a terminated string with the name of the seller followed
   by a terminated string with a short description of the product. The
   last thing is the ability to include a company logotype. The first of
   them is the 'Picture MIME type' field containing information about
   which picture format is used. In the event that the MIME media type
   name is omitted, "image/" will be implied. Currently only "image/png"
   and "image/jpeg" are allowed. This format string is followed by the
   binary picture data. This two last fields may be omitted if no
   picture is to attach.

     <Header for 'Commercial frame', ID: "COMR">
     Text encoding      $xx
     Price string       <text string> $00
     Valid until        <text string>
     Contact URL        <text string> $00
     Received as        $xx
     Name of seller     <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Description        <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Picture MIME type  <string> $00
     Seller logo        <binary data>


4.26.   Encryption method registration

   To identify with which method a frame has been encrypted the
   encryption method must be registered in the tag with this frame. The
   'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for this specific encryption method. Questions regarding the
   encryption method should be sent to the indicated email address. The
   'Method symbol' contains a value that is associated with this method
   throughout the whole tag. Values below $80 are reserved. The 'Method
   symbol' may optionally be followed by encryption specific data. There
   may be several "ENCR" frames in a tag but only one containing the
   same symbol and only one containing the same owner identifier. The
   method must be used somewhere in the tag. See section 3.3.1, flag j
   for more information.

     <Header for 'Encryption method registration', ID: "ENCR">
     Owner identifier    <text string> $00
     Method symbol       $xx
     Encryption data     <binary data>


4.27.   Group identification registration

   This frame enables grouping of otherwise unrelated frames. This can
   be used when some frames are to be signed. To identify which frames
   belongs to a set of frames a group identifier must be registered in
   the tag with this frame. The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated
   string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a link to a
   location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
   organisation responsible for this grouping. Questions regarding the
   grouping should be sent to the indicated email address. The 'Group
   symbol' contains a value that associates the frame with this group
   throughout the whole tag. Values below $80 are reserved. The 'Group
   symbol' may optionally be followed by some group specific data, e.g.
   a digital signature. There may be several "GRID" frames in a tag but
   only one containing the same symbol and only one containing the same
   owner identifier. The group symbol must be used somewhere in the tag.
   See section 3.3.1, flag j for more information.

     <Header for 'Group ID registration', ID: "GRID">
     Owner identifier      <text string> $00
     Group symbol          $xx
         Group dependent data  <binary data>


4.28.   Private frame

   This frame is used to contain information from a software producer
   that its program uses and does not fit into the other frames. The
   frame consists of an 'Owner identifier' string and the binary data.
   The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for the frame. Questions regarding the frame should be sent to the
   indicated email address. The tag may contain more than one "PRIV"
   frame but only with different contents. It is recommended to keep the
   number of "PRIV" frames as low as possible.

     <Header for 'Private frame', ID: "PRIV">
     Owner identifier      <text string> $00
         The private data      <binary data>


5.   The 'unsynchronisation scheme'

   The only purpose of the 'unsynchronisation scheme' is to make the
   ID3v2 tag as compatible as possible with existing software. There is
   no use in 'unsynchronising' tags if the file is only to be processed
   by new software. Unsynchronisation may only be made with MPEG 2 layer
   I, II and III and MPEG 2.5 files.

   Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed
   byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte. The
   format of a correct sync that should be altered by ID3 encoders is as
   follows:

         %11111111 111xxxxx

   And should be replaced with:

         %11111111 00000000 111xxxxx

   This has the side effect that all $FF 00 combinations have to be
   altered, so they won't be affected by the decoding process. Therefore
   all the $FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the $FF 00 00
   combination during the unsynchronisation.

   To indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the first bit in 'ID3
   flags' should be set. This bit should only be set if the tag
   contains a, now corrected, false synchronisation. The bit should
   only be clear if the tag does not contain any false synchronisations.

   Do bear in mind, that if a compression scheme is used by the encoder,
   the unsynchronisation scheme should be applied *afterwards*. When
   decoding a compressed, 'unsynchronised' file, the 'unsynchronisation
   scheme' should be parsed first, decompression afterwards.

   If the last byte in the tag is $FF, and there is a need to eliminate
   false synchronisations in the tag, at least one byte of padding
   should be added.

                 ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure

Status of this document

   This document is an informal standard and replaces the ID3v2.3.0
   standard [ID3v2]. A formal standard will use another revision number
   even if the content is identical to document. The contents in this
   document may change for clarifications but never for added or altered
   functionallity.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.


Abstract

   This document describes the main structure of ID3v2.4.0, which is a
   revised version of the ID3v2 informal standard [ID3v2] version
   2.3.0. The ID3v2 offers a flexible way of storing audio meta
   information within the audio file itself. The information may be
   technical information, such as equalisation curves, as well as
   title, performer, copyright etc.

   ID3v2.4.0 is meant to be as close as possible to ID3v2.3.0 in order
   to allow for implementations to be revised as easily as possible.

2.   Conventions in this document

   Text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a tag.
   Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers preceded with %
   are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x
   is used to indicate a bit with unknown content. The most significant
   bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit
   (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.

   A tag is the whole tag described in this document. A frame is a block
   of information in the tag. The tag consists of a header, frames and
   optional padding. A field is a piece of information; one value, a
   string etc. A numeric string is a string that consists of the
   characters "0123456789" only.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


3.   ID3v2 overview

   ID3v2 is a general tagging format for audio, which makes it possible
   to store meta data about the audio inside the audio file itself. The
   ID3 tag described in this document is mainly targeted at files
   encoded with MPEG-1/2 layer I, MPEG-1/2 layer II, MPEG-1/2 layer III
   and MPEG-2.5, but may work with other types of encoded audio or as a
   stand alone format for audio meta data.

   ID3v2 is designed to be as flexible and expandable as possible to
   meet new meta information needs that might arise. To achieve that
   ID3v2 is constructed as a container for several information blocks,
   called frames, whose format need not be known to the software that
   encounters them. At the start of every frame is an unique and
   predefined identifier, a size descriptor that allows software to skip
   unknown frames and a flags field. The flags describes encoding
   details and if the frame should remain in the tag, should it be
   unknown to the software, if the file is altered.

   The bitorder in ID3v2 is most significant bit first (MSB). The
   byteorder in multibyte numbers is most significant byte first (e.g.
   $12345678 would be encoded $12 34 56 78), also known as big endian
   and network byte order.

   Overall tag structure:

     +-----------------------------+
     |      Header (10 bytes)      |
     +-----------------------------+
     |       Extended Header       |
     | (variable length, OPTIONAL) |
     +-----------------------------+
     |   Frames (variable length)  |
     +-----------------------------+
     |           Padding           |
     | (variable length, OPTIONAL) |
     +-----------------------------+
     | Footer (10 bytes, OPTIONAL) |
     +-----------------------------+

   In general, padding and footer are mutually exclusive. See details in
   sections 3.3, 3.4 and 5.


3.1.   ID3v2 header

   The first part of the ID3v2 tag is the 10 byte tag header, laid out
   as follows:

     ID3v2/file identifier      "ID3"
     ID3v2 version              $04 00
     ID3v2 flags                %abcd0000
     ID3v2 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx

   The first three bytes of the tag are always "ID3", to indicate that
   this is an ID3v2 tag, directly followed by the two version bytes. The
   first byte of ID3v2 version is its major version, while the second
   byte is its revision number. In this case this is ID3v2.4.0. All
   revisions are backwards compatible while major versions are not. If
   software with ID3v2.4.0 and below support should encounter version
   five or higher it should simply ignore the whole tag. Version or
   revision will never be $FF.

   The version is followed by the ID3v2 flags field, of which currently
   four flags are used.


   a - Unsynchronisation

     Bit 7 in the 'ID3v2 flags' indicates whether or not
     unsynchronisation is applied on all frames (see section 6.1 for
     details); a set bit indicates usage.


   b - Extended header

     The second bit (bit 6) indicates whether or not the header is
     followed by an extended header. The extended header is described in
     section 3.2. A set bit indicates the presence of an extended
     header.


   c - Experimental indicator

     The third bit (bit 5) is used as an 'experimental indicator'. This
     flag SHALL always be set when the tag is in an experimental stage.


   d - Footer present

     Bit 4 indicates that a footer (section 3.4) is present at the very
     end of the tag. A set bit indicates the presence of a footer.


   All the other flags MUST be cleared. If one of these undefined flags
   are set, the tag might not be readable for a parser that does not
   know the flags function.

   The ID3v2 tag size is stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer (section
   6.2), making a total of 28 effective bits (representing up to 256MB).

   The ID3v2 tag size is the sum of the byte length of the extended
   header, the padding and the frames after unsynchronisation. If a
   footer is present this equals to ('total size' - 20) bytes, otherwise
   ('total size' - 10) bytes.

   An ID3v2 tag can be detected with the following pattern:
     $49 44 33 yy yy xx zz zz zz zz
   Where yy is less than $FF, xx is the 'flags' byte and zz is less than
   $80.


3.2. Extended header

   The extended header contains information that can provide further
   insight in the structure of the tag, but is not vital to the correct
   parsing of the tag information; hence the extended header is
   optional.

     Extended header size   4 * %0xxxxxxx
     Number of flag bytes       $01
     Extended Flags             $xx

   Where the 'Extended header size' is the size of the whole extended
   header, stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer. An extended header can
   thus never have a size of fewer than six bytes.

   The extended flags field, with its size described by 'number of flag
   bytes', is defined as:

     %0bcd0000

   Each flag that is set in the extended header has data attached, which
   comes in the order in which the flags are encountered (i.e. the data
   for flag 'b' comes before the data for flag 'c'). Unset flags cannot
   have any attached data. All unknown flags MUST be unset and their
   corresponding data removed when a tag is modified.

   Every set flag's data starts with a length byte, which contains a
   value between 0 and 128 ($00 - $7f), followed by data that has the
   field length indicated by the length byte. If a flag has no attached
   data, the value $00 is used as length byte.


   b - Tag is an update

     If this flag is set, the present tag is an update of a tag found
     earlier in the present file or stream. If frames defined as unique
     are found in the present tag, they are to override any
     corresponding ones found in the earlier tag. This flag has no
     corresponding data.

         Flag data length      $00

   c - CRC data present

     If this flag is set, a CRC-32 [ISO-3309] data is included in the
     extended header. The CRC is calculated on all the data between the
     header and footer as indicated by the header's tag length field,
     minus the extended header. Note that this includes the padding (if
     there is any), but excludes the footer. The CRC-32 is stored as an
     35 bit synchsafe integer, leaving the upper four bits always
     zeroed.

        Flag data length       $05
        Total frame CRC    5 * %0xxxxxxx

   d - Tag restrictions

     For some applications it might be desired to restrict a tag in more
     ways than imposed by the ID3v2 specification. Note that the
     presence of these restrictions does not affect how the tag is
     decoded, merely how it was restricted before encoding. If this flag
     is set the tag is restricted as follows:

        Flag data length       $01
        Restrictions           %ppqrrstt

     p - Tag size restrictions

       00   No more than 128 frames and 1 MB total tag size.
       01   No more than 64 frames and 128 KB total tag size.
       10   No more than 32 frames and 40 KB total tag size.
       11   No more than 32 frames and 4 KB total tag size.

     q - Text encoding restrictions

       0    No restrictions
       1    Strings are only encoded with ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1] or
            UTF-8 [UTF-8].

     r - Text fields size restrictions

       00   No restrictions
       01   No string is longer than 1024 characters.
       10   No string is longer than 128 characters.
       11   No string is longer than 30 characters.

       Note that nothing is said about how many bytes is used to
       represent those characters, since it is encoding dependent. If a
       text frame consists of more than one string, the sum of the
       strungs is restricted as stated.

     s - Image encoding restrictions

       0   No restrictions
       1   Images are encoded only with PNG [PNG] or JPEG [JFIF].

     t - Image size restrictions

       00  No restrictions
       01  All images are 256x256 pixels or smaller.
       10  All images are 64x64 pixels or smaller.
       11  All images are exactly 64x64 pixels, unless required
           otherwise.


3.3.   Padding

   It is OPTIONAL to include padding after the final frame (at the end
   of the ID3 tag), making the size of all the frames together smaller
   than the size given in the tag header. A possible purpose of this
   padding is to allow for adding a few additional frames or enlarge
   existing frames within the tag without having to rewrite the entire
   file. The value of the padding bytes must be $00. A tag MUST NOT have
   any padding between the frames or between the tag header and the
   frames. Furthermore it MUST NOT have any padding when a tag footer is
   added to the tag.


3.4.   ID3v2 footer

   To speed up the process of locating an ID3v2 tag when searching from
   the end of a file, a footer can be added to the tag. It is REQUIRED
   to add a footer to an appended tag, i.e. a tag located after all
   audio data. The footer is a copy of the header, but with a different
   identifier.

     ID3v2 identifier           "3DI"
     ID3v2 version              $04 00
     ID3v2 flags                %abcd0000
     ID3v2 size             4 * %0xxxxxxx


4.   ID3v2 frame overview

   All ID3v2 frames consists of one frame header followed by one or more
   fields containing the actual information. The header is always 10
   bytes and laid out as follows:

     Frame ID      $xx xx xx xx  (four characters)
     Size      4 * %0xxxxxxx
     Flags         $xx xx

   The frame ID is made out of the characters capital A-Z and 0-9.
   Identifiers beginning with "X", "Y" and "Z" are for experimental
   frames and free for everyone to use, without the need to set the
   experimental bit in the tag header. Bear in mind that someone else
   might have used the same identifier as you. All other identifiers are
   either used or reserved for future use.

   The frame ID is followed by a size descriptor containing the size of
   the data in the final frame, after encryption, compression and
   unsynchronisation. The size is excluding the frame header ('total
   frame size' - 10 bytes) and stored as a 32 bit synchsafe integer.

   In the frame header the size descriptor is followed by two flag
   bytes. These flags are described in section 4.1.

   There is no fixed order of the frames' appearance in the tag,
   although it is desired that the frames are arranged in order of
   significance concerning the recognition of the file. An example of
   such order: UFID, TIT2, MCDI, TRCK ...

   A tag MUST contain at least one frame. A frame must be at least 1
   byte big, excluding the header.

   If nothing else is said, strings, including numeric strings and URLs
   [URL], are represented as ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1] characters in the
   range $20 - $FF. Such strings are represented in frame descriptions
   as <text string>, or <full text string> if newlines are allowed. If
   nothing else is said newline character is forbidden. In ISO-8859-1 a
   newline is represented, when allowed, with $0A only.

   Frames that allow different types of text encoding contains a text
   encoding description byte. Possible encodings:

     $00   ISO-8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. Terminated with $00.
     $01   UTF-16 [UTF-16] encoded Unicode [UNICODE] with BOM. All
           strings in the same frame SHALL have the same byteorder.
           Terminated with $00 00.
     $02   UTF-16BE [UTF-16] encoded Unicode [UNICODE] without BOM.
           Terminated with $00 00.
     $03   UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoded Unicode [UNICODE]. Terminated with $00.

   Strings dependent on encoding are represented in frame descriptions
   as <text string according to encoding>, or <full text string
   according to encoding> if newlines are allowed. Any empty strings of
   type $01 which are NULL-terminated may have the Unicode BOM followed
   by a Unicode NULL ($FF FE 00 00 or $FE FF 00 00).

   The timestamp fields are based on a subset of ISO 8601. When being as
   precise as possible the format of a time string is
   yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss (year, "-", month, "-", day, "T", hour (out of
   24), ":", minutes, ":", seconds), but the precision may be reduced by
   removing as many time indicators as wanted. Hence valid timestamps
   are
   yyyy, yyyy-MM, yyyy-MM-dd, yyyy-MM-ddTHH, yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm and
   yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss. All time stamps are UTC. For durations, use
   the slash character as described in 8601, and for multiple non-
   contiguous dates, use multiple strings, if allowed by the frame
   definition.

   The three byte language field, present in several frames, is used to
   describe the language of the frame's content, according to ISO-639-2
   [ISO-639-2]. The language should be represented in lower case. If the
   language is not known the string "XXX" should be used.

   All URLs [URL] MAY be relative, e.g. "picture.png", "../doc.txt".

   If a frame is longer than it should be, e.g. having more fields than
   specified in this document, that indicates that additions to the
   frame have been made in a later version of the ID3v2 standard. This
   is reflected by the revision number in the header of the tag.


4.1.   Frame header flags

   In the frame header the size descriptor is followed by two flag
   bytes. All unused flags MUST be cleared. The first byte is for
   'status messages' and the second byte is a format description. If an
   unknown flag is set in the first byte the frame MUST NOT be changed
   without that bit cleared. If an unknown flag is set in the second
   byte the frame is likely to not be readable. Some flags in the second
   byte indicates that extra information is added to the header. These
   fields of extra information is ordered as the flags that indicates
   them. The flags field is defined as follows (l and o left out because
   ther resemblence to one and zero):

     %0abc0000 %0h00kmnp

   Some frame format flags indicate that additional information fields
   are added to the frame. This information is added after the frame
   header and before the frame data in the same order as the flags that
   indicates them. I.e. the four bytes of decompressed size will precede
   the encryption method byte. These additions affects the 'frame size'
   field, but are not subject to encryption or compression.
   
   The default status flags setting for a frame is, unless stated
   otherwise, 'preserved if tag is altered' and 'preserved if file is
   altered', i.e. %00000000.


4.1.1. Frame status flags

   a - Tag alter preservation

     This flag tells the tag parser what to do with this frame if it is
     unknown and the tag is altered in any way. This applies to all
     kinds of alterations, including adding more padding and reordering
     the frames.

     0     Frame should be preserved.
     1     Frame should be discarded.


   b - File alter preservation

     This flag tells the tag parser what to do with this frame if it is
     unknown and the file, excluding the tag, is altered. This does not
     apply when the audio is completely replaced with other audio data.

     0     Frame should be preserved.
     1     Frame should be discarded.


   c - Read only

      This flag, if set, tells the software that the contents of this
      frame are intended to be read only. Changing the contents might
      break something, e.g. a signature. If the contents are changed,
      without knowledge of why the frame was flagged read only and
      without taking the proper means to compensate, e.g. recalculating
      the signature, the bit MUST be cleared.


4.1.2. Frame format flags

   h - Grouping identity

      This flag indicates whether or not this frame belongs in a group
      with other frames. If set, a group identifier byte is added to the
      frame. Every frame with the same group identifier belongs to the
      same group.

      0     Frame does not contain group information
      1     Frame contains group information


   k - Compression

      This flag indicates whether or not the frame is compressed.
      A 'Data Length Indicator' byte MUST be included in the frame.

      0     Frame is not compressed.
      1     Frame is compressed using zlib [zlib] deflate method.
            If set, this requires the 'Data Length Indicator' bit
            to be set as well.


   m - Encryption
   
      This flag indicates whether or not the frame is encrypted. If set,
      one byte indicating with which method it was encrypted will be
      added to the frame. See description of the ENCR frame for more
      information about encryption method registration. Encryption
      should be done after compression. Whether or not setting this flag
      requires the presence of a 'Data Length Indicator' depends on the
      specific algorithm used.

      0     Frame is not encrypted.
      1     Frame is encrypted.

   n - Unsynchronisation

      This flag indicates whether or not unsynchronisation was applied
      to this frame. See section 6 for details on unsynchronisation.
      If this flag is set all data from the end of this header to the
      end of this frame has been unsynchronised. Although desirable, the
      presence of a 'Data Length Indicator' is not made mandatory by
      unsynchronisation.

      0     Frame has not been unsynchronised.
      1     Frame has been unsyrchronised.

   p - Data length indicator

      This flag indicates that a data length indicator has been added to
      the frame. The data length indicator is the value one would write
      as the 'Frame length' if all of the frame format flags were
      zeroed, represented as a 32 bit synchsafe integer.

      0      There is no Data Length Indicator.
      1      A data length Indicator has been added to the frame.


5.   Tag location

   The default location of an ID3v2 tag is prepended to the audio so
   that players can benefit from the information when the data is
   streamed. It is however possible to append the tag, or make a
   prepend/append combination. When deciding upon where an unembedded
   tag should be located, the following order of preference SHOULD be
   considered.
   
     1. Prepend the tag.

     2. Prepend a tag with all vital information and add a second tag at 
        the end of the file, before tags from other tagging systems. The
        first tag is required to have a SEEK frame.
      
     3. Add a tag at the end of the file, before tags from other tagging
        systems.
      
   In case 2 and 3 the tag can simply be appended if no other known tags
   are present. The suggested method to find ID3v2 tags are:
   
     1. Look for a prepended tag using the pattern found in section 3.1.

     2. If a SEEK frame was found, use its values to guide further
        searching.

     3. Look for a tag footer, scanning from the back of the file.

   For every new tag that is found, the old tag should be discarded
   unless the update flag in the extended header (section 3.2) is set.
   

6.   Unsynchronisation

   The only purpose of unsynchronisation is to make the ID3v2 tag as
   compatible as possible with existing software and hardware. There is
   no use in 'unsynchronising' tags if the file is only to be processed
   only by ID3v2 aware software and hardware. Unsynchronisation is only
   useful with tags in MPEG 1/2 layer I, II and III, MPEG 2.5 and AAC
   files.


6.1.   The unsynchronisation scheme

   Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed
   byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte. The
   format of synchronisations that should be altered by ID3 encoders is
   as follows:

         %11111111 111xxxxx

   and should be replaced with:

         %11111111 00000000 111xxxxx

   This has the side effect that all $FF 00 combinations have to be
   altered, so they will not be affected by the decoding process.
   Therefore all the $FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the
   $FF 00 00 combination during the unsynchronisation.

   To indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the unsynchronisation
   flag in the frame header should be set. This bit MUST be set if the
   frame was altered by the unsynchronisation and SHOULD NOT be set if
   unaltered. If all frames in the tag are unsynchronised the
   unsynchronisation flag in the tag header SHOULD be set. It MUST NOT
   be set if the tag has a frame which is not unsynchronised.

   Assume the first byte of the audio to be $FF. The special case when
   the last byte of the last frame is $FF and no padding nor footer is
   used will then introduce a false synchronisation. This can be solved
   by adding a footer, adding padding or unsynchronising the frame and
   add $00 to the end of the frame data, thus adding more byte to the
   frame size than a normal unsynchronisation would. Although not
   preferred, it is allowed to apply the last method on all frames
   ending with $FF.

   It is preferred that the tag is either completely unsynchronised or
   not unsynchronised at all. A completely unsynchronised tag has no 
   false synchonisations in it, as defined above, and does not end with
   $FF. A completely non-unsynchronised tag contains no unsynchronised
   frames, and thus the unsynchronisation flag in the header is cleared.

   Do bear in mind, that if compression or encryption is used, the
   unsynchronisation scheme MUST be applied afterwards. When decoding an
   unsynchronised frame, the unsynchronisation scheme MUST be reversed
   first, encryption and decompression afterwards.


6.2.   Synchsafe integers

   In some parts of the tag it is inconvenient to use the
   unsychronisation scheme because the size of unsynchronised data is
   not known in advance, which is particularly problematic with size
   descriptors. The solution in ID3v2 is to use synchsafe integers, in
   which there can never be any false synchs. Synchsafe integers are
   integers that keep its highest bit (bit 7) zeroed, making seven bits
   out of eight available. Thus a 32 bit synchsafe integer can store 28
   bits of information.
   
   Example:
   
     255 (%11111111) encoded as a 16 bit synchsafe integer is 383
     (%00000001 01111111).

                  ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Native Frames

Status of this document

   This document is an informal standard and replaces the ID3v2.3.0
   standard [ID3v2]. A formal standard will use another revision number
   even if the content is identical to document. The contents in this
   document may change for clarifications but never for added or altered
   functionallity.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.


Abstract

   This document describes the frames natively supported by ID3v2.4.0,
   which is a revised version of the ID3v2 informal standard [ID3v2.3.0]
   version 2.3.0. The ID3v2 offers a flexible way of storing audio meta
   information within audio file itself. The information may be
   technical information, such as equalisation curves, as well as title,
   performer, copyright etc.

   ID3v2.4.0 is meant to be as close as possible to ID3v2.3.0 in order
   to allow for implementations to be revised as easily as possible.

2.   Conventions in this document

   Text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a tag.
   Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers preceded with %
   are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x
   is used to indicate a bit with unknown content. The most significant
   bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit
   (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.

   A tag is the whole tag described the ID3v2 main structure document
   [ID3v2-strct]. A frame is a block of information in the tag. The tag
   consists of a header, frames and optional padding. A field is a piece
   of information; one value, a string etc. A numeric string is a string
   that consists of the characters "0123456789" only.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


3.   Default flags

   The default settings for the frames described in this document can be
   divided into the following classes. The flags may be set differently
   if found more suitable by the software.

    1. Discarded if tag is altered, discarded if file is altered.

       None.

    2. Discarded if tag is altered, preserved if file is altered.

       None.

    3. Preserved if tag is altered, discarded if file is altered.

4.1.   Unique file identifier

   This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a
   database, that may provide more information relevant to the content.
   Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all
   UFID frames begin with an 'owner identifier' field. It is a null-
   terminated string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a
   link to a location where an email address can be found, that belongs
   to the organisation responsible for this specific database
   implementation. Questions regarding the database should be sent to
   the indicated email address. The URL should not be used for the
   actual database queries. The string
   "http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html" should be used for tests. The
   'Owner identifier' must be non-empty (more than just a termination).
   The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier,
   which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one "UFID" frame
   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.

     <Header for 'Unique file identifier', ID: "UFID">
     Owner identifier        <text string> $00
     Identifier              <up to 64 bytes binary data>


4.2.   Text information frames

   The text information frames are often the most important frames,
   containing information like artist, album and more. There may only be
   one text information frame of its kind in an tag. All text
   information frames supports multiple strings, stored as a null
   separated list, where null is reperesented by the termination code
   for the charater encoding. All text frame identifiers begin with "T".
   Only text frame identifiers begin with "T", with the exception of the
   "TXXX" frame. All the text information frames have the following
   format:

     <Header for 'Text information frame', ID: "T000" - "TZZZ",
     excluding "TXXX" described in 4.2.6.>
     Text encoding                $xx
     Information                  <text string(s) according to encoding>


4.2.1.   Identification frames

  TIT1
   The 'Content group description' frame is used if the sound belongs to
   a larger category of sounds/music. For example, classical music is
   often sorted in different musical sections (e.g. "Piano Concerto",
   "Weather - Hurricane").

  TIT2
   The 'Title/Songname/Content description' frame is the actual name of
   the piece (e.g. "Adagio", "Hurricane Donna").

  TIT3
   The 'Subtitle/Description refinement' frame is used for information
   directly related to the contents title (e.g. "Op. 16" or "Performed
   live at Wembley").

  TALB
   The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the
   recording (or source of sound) from which the audio in the file is
   taken.

  TOAL
   The 'Original album/movie/show title' frame is intended for the title
   of the original recording (or source of sound), if for example the
   music in the file should be a cover of a previously released song.

  TRCK
   The 'Track number/Position in set' frame is a numeric string
   containing the order number of the audio-file on its original
   recording. This MAY be extended with a "/" character and a numeric
   string containing the total number of tracks/elements on the original
   recording. E.g. "4/9".

  TPOS
   The 'Part of a set' frame is a numeric string that describes which
   part of a set the audio came from. This frame is used if the source
   described in the "TALB" frame is divided into several mediums, e.g. a
   double CD. The value MAY be extended with a "/" character and a
   numeric string containing the total number of parts in the set. E.g.
   "1/2".

  TSST
   The 'Set subtitle' frame is intended for the subtitle of the part of
   a set this track belongs to.

  TSRC
   The 'ISRC' frame should contain the International Standard Recording
   Code [ISRC] (12 characters).


4.2.2.   Involved persons frames

  TPE1
   The 'Lead artist/Lead performer/Soloist/Performing group' is
   used for the main artist.

  TPE2
   The 'Band/Orchestra/Accompaniment' frame is used for additional
   information about the performers in the recording.

  TPE3
   The 'Conductor' frame is used for the name of the conductor.

  TPE4
   The 'Interpreted, remixed, or otherwise modified by' frame contains
   more information about the people behind a remix and similar
   interpretations of another existing piece.

  TOPE
   The 'Original artist/performer' frame is intended for the performer
   of the original recording, if for example the music in the file
   should be a cover of a previously released song.

  TEXT
   The 'Lyricist/Text writer' frame is intended for the writer of the
   text or lyrics in the recording.

  TOLY
   The 'Original lyricist/text writer' frame is intended for the
   text writer of the original recording, if for example the music in
   the file should be a cover of a previously released song.

  TCOM
   The 'Composer' frame is intended for the name of the composer.

  TMCL
   The 'Musician credits list' is intended as a mapping between
   instruments and the musician that played it. Every odd field is an
   instrument and every even is an artist or a comma delimited list of
   artists.

  TIPL
   The 'Involved people list' is very similar to the musician credits
   list, but maps between functions, like producer, and names.

  TENC
   The 'Encoded by' frame contains the name of the person or
   organisation that encoded the audio file. This field may contain a
   copyright message, if the audio file also is copyrighted by the
   encoder.


4.2.3.   Derived and subjective properties frames

  TBPM
   The 'BPM' frame contains the number of beats per minute in the
   main part of the audio. The BPM is an integer and represented as a
   numerical string.

  TLEN
   The 'Length' frame contains the length of the audio file in
   milliseconds, represented as a numeric string.

  TKEY
   The 'Initial key' frame contains the musical key in which the sound
   starts. It is represented as a string with a maximum length of three
   characters. The ground keys are represented with "A","B","C","D","E",
   "F" and "G" and halfkeys represented with "b" and "#". Minor is
   represented as "m", e.g. "Dbm" $00. Off key is represented with an
   "o" only.

  TLAN
   The 'Language' frame should contain the languages of the text or
   lyrics spoken or sung in the audio. The language is represented with
   three characters according to ISO-639-2 [ISO-639-2]. If more than one
   language is used in the text their language codes should follow
   according to the amount of their usage, e.g. "eng" $00 "sve" $00.

  TCON
   The 'Content type', which ID3v1 was stored as a one byte numeric
   value only, is now a string. You may use one or several of the ID3v1
   types as numerical strings, or, since the category list would be
   impossible to maintain with accurate and up to date categories,
   define your own. Example: "21" $00 "Eurodisco" $00

   You may also use any of the following keywords:
   
     RX  Remix
     CR  Cover

  TFLT
   The 'File type' frame indicates which type of audio this tag defines.
   The following types and refinements are defined:

     MIME   MIME type follows
     MPG    MPEG Audio
       /1     MPEG 1/2 layer I
       /2     MPEG 1/2 layer II
       /3     MPEG 1/2 layer III
       /2.5   MPEG 2.5
       /AAC   Advanced audio compression
     VQF    Transform-domain Weighted Interleave Vector Quantisation
     PCM    Pulse Code Modulated audio

   but other types may be used, but not for these types though. This is
   used in a similar way to the predefined types in the "TMED" frame,
   but without parentheses. If this frame is not present audio type is
   assumed to be "MPG".

  TMED
   The 'Media type' frame describes from which media the sound
   originated. This may be a text string or a reference to the
   predefined media types found in the list below. Example:
   "VID/PAL/VHS" $00.

      /IV   Type IV cassette (metal)

  TMOO
   The 'Mood' frame is intended to reflect the mood of the audio with a
   few keywords, e.g. "Romantic" or "Sad".


4.2.4.   Rights and license frames

  TCOP
   The 'Copyright message' frame, in which the string must begin with a
   year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for
   the copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file
   itself. The absence of this frame means only that the copyright
   information is unavailable or has been removed, and must not be
   interpreted to mean that the audio is public domain. Every time this
   field is displayed the field must be preceded with "Copyright " (C) "
   ", where (C) is one character showing a C in a circle.

  TPRO
   The 'Produced notice' frame, in which the string must begin with a
   year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for
   the production copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio
   file itself. The absence of this frame means only that the production
   copyright information is unavailable or has been removed, and must
   not be interpreted to mean that the audio is public domain. Every
   time this field is displayed the field must be preceded with
   "Produced " (P) " ", where (P) is one character showing a P in a
   circle.

  TPUB
   The 'Publisher' frame simply contains the name of the label or
   publisher.

  TOWN
   The 'File owner/licensee' frame contains the name of the owner or
   licensee of the file and it's contents.

  TRSN
   The 'Internet radio station name' frame contains the name of the
   internet radio station from which the audio is streamed.

  TRSO
   The 'Internet radio station owner' frame contains the name of the
   owner of the internet radio station from which the audio is
   streamed.

4.2.5.   Other text frames

  TOFN
   The 'Original filename' frame contains the preferred filename for the
   file, since some media doesn't allow the desired length of the
   filename. The filename is case sensitive and includes its suffix.

  TDLY
   The 'Playlist delay' defines the numbers of milliseconds of silence
   that should be inserted before this audio. The value zero indicates
   that this is a part of a multifile audio track that should be played
   continuously.

  TDEN
   The 'Encoding time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
   audio was encoded. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDOR
   The 'Original release time' frame contains a timestamp describing
   when the original recording of the audio was released. Timestamp
   format is described in the ID3v2 structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDRC
   The 'Recording time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
   audio was recorded. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDRL
   The 'Release time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
   audio was first released. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TDTG
   The 'Tagging time' frame contains a timestamp describing then the
   audio was tagged. Timestamp format is described in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct].

  TSSE
   The 'Software/Hardware and settings used for encoding' frame
   includes the used audio encoder and its settings when the file was
   encoded. Hardware refers to hardware encoders, not the computer on
   which a program was run.

  TSOA
   The 'Album sort order' frame defines a string which should be used
   instead of the album name (TALB) for sorting purposes. E.g. an album
   named "A Soundtrack" might preferably be sorted as "Soundtrack".

  TSOP
   The 'Performer sort order' frame defines a string which should be
   used instead of the performer (TPE2) for sorting purposes.

  TSOT
   The 'Title sort order' frame defines a string which should be used
   instead of the title (TIT2) for sorting purposes.


4.2.6.   User defined text information frame

   This frame is intended for one-string text information concerning the
   audio file in a similar way to the other "T"-frames. The frame body
   consists of a description of the string, represented as a terminated
   string, followed by the actual string. There may be more than one
   "TXXX" frame in each tag, but only one with the same description.

     <Header for 'User defined text information frame', ID: "TXXX">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Description       <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Value             <text string according to encoding>


4.3.   URL link frames

   With these frames dynamic data such as webpages with touring
   information, price information or plain ordinary news can be added to
   the tag. There may only be one URL [URL] link frame of its kind in an
   tag, except when stated otherwise in the frame description. If the
   text string is followed by a string termination, all the following
   information should be ignored and not be displayed. All URL link
   frame identifiers begins with "W". Only URL link frame identifiers
   begins with "W", except for "WXXX". All URL link frames have the
   following format:

     <Header for 'URL link frame', ID: "W000" - "WZZZ", excluding "WXXX"
     described in 4.3.2.>
     URL              <text string>


4.3.1.   URL link frames - details

  WCOM
   The 'Commercial information' frame is a URL pointing at a webpage
   with information such as where the album can be bought. There may be
   more than one "WCOM" frame in a tag, but not with the same content.

  WCOP
   The 'Copyright/Legal information' frame is a URL pointing at a
   webpage where the terms of use and ownership of the file is
   described.

  WOAF
   The 'Official audio file webpage' frame is a URL pointing at a file
   specific webpage.

  WOAR
   The 'Official artist/performer webpage' frame is a URL pointing at
   the artists official webpage. There may be more than one "WOAR" frame
   in a tag if the audio contains more than one performer, but not with
   the same content.

  WOAS
   The 'Official audio source webpage' frame is a URL pointing at the
   official webpage for the source of the audio file, e.g. a movie.

  WORS
   The 'Official Internet radio station homepage' contains a URL
   pointing at the homepage of the internet radio station.

  WPAY
   The 'Payment' frame is a URL pointing at a webpage that will handle
   the process of paying for this file.

  WPUB
   The 'Publishers official webpage' frame is a URL pointing at the
   official webpage for the publisher.


4.3.2.   User defined URL link frame

   This frame is intended for URL [URL] links concerning the audio file
   in a similar way to the other "W"-frames. The frame body consists
   of a description of the string, represented as a terminated string,
   followed by the actual URL. The URL is always encoded with ISO-8859-1
   [ISO-8859-1]. There may be more than one "WXXX" frame in each tag,
   but only one with the same description.

     <Header for 'User defined URL link frame', ID: "WXXX">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Description       <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     URL               <text string>


4.4.   Music CD identifier

   This frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD
   can be identified in databases such as the CDDB [CDDB]. The frame
   consists of a binary dump of the Table Of Contents, TOC, from the CD,
   which is a header of 4 bytes and then 8 bytes/track on the CD plus 8
   bytes for the 'lead out', making a maximum of 804 bytes. The offset
   to the beginning of every track on the CD should be described with a
   four bytes absolute CD-frame address per track, and not with absolute
   time. When this frame is used the presence of a valid "TRCK" frame is
   REQUIRED, even if the CD's only got one track. It is recommended that
   this frame is always added to tags originating from CDs. There may
   only be one "MCDI" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Music CD identifier', ID: "MCDI">
     CD TOC                <binary data>


4.5.   Event timing codes

   This frame allows synchronisation with key events in the audio. The
   header is:

     <Header for 'Event timing codes', ID: "ETCO">
     Time stamp format    $xx

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.

   Followed by a list of key events in the following format:

     Type of event   $xx
     Time stamp      $xx (xx ...)

   The 'Time stamp' is set to zero if directly at the beginning of the
   sound or after the previous event. All events MUST be sorted in
   chronological order. The type of event is as follows:

     $00  padding (has no meaning)
     $01  end of initial silence
     $02  intro start
     $03  main part start
     $04  outro start
     $05  outro end
     $06  verse start
     $07  refrain start
     $08  interlude start
     $09  theme start
     $0A  variation start
     $0B  key change
     $0C  time change
     $0D  momentary unwanted noise (Snap, Crackle & Pop)
     $0E  sustained noise
     $0F  sustained noise end
     $10  intro end
     $11  main part end
     $12  verse end
     $13  refrain end
     $14  theme end
     $15  profanity
     $16  profanity end

     $17-$DF  reserved for future use

     $E0-$EF  not predefined synch 0-F

     $F0-$FC  reserved for future use

     $FD  audio end (start of silence)
     $FE  audio file ends
     $FF  one more byte of events follows (all the following bytes with
          the value $FF have the same function)

   Terminating the start events such as "intro start" is OPTIONAL. The
   'Not predefined synch's ($E0-EF) are for user events. You might want
   to synchronise your music to something, like setting off an explosion
   on-stage, activating a screensaver etc.

   There may only be one "ETCO" frame in each tag.


4.6.   MPEG location lookup table

   To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG [MPEG]
   audio file, frames with time codes in different locations in the file
   might be useful. This ID3v2 frame includes references that the
   software can use to calculate positions in the file. After the frame
   header follows a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should be
   increased for every reference. If this value is two then the first
   reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th
   frame, the 3rd reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the
   'bytes between reference' and 'milliseconds between reference' points
   out bytes and milliseconds respectively.

   Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
   defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
   between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
   a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
   deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
   'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
   in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for
   milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only
   be one "MLLT" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Location lookup table', ID: "MLLT">
     MPEG frames between reference  $xx xx
     Bytes between reference        $xx xx xx
     Milliseconds between reference $xx xx xx
     Bits for bytes deviation       $xx
     Bits for milliseconds dev.     $xx

   Then for every reference the following data is included;

     Deviation in bytes         %xxx....
     Deviation in milliseconds  %xxx....


4.7.   Synchronised tempo codes

   For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece, this
   frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing
   which time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more
   tempo codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time
   part. The tempo is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the
   first byte has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added
   to the first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is
   reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time period, which is
   not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one
   single beat-stroke followed by a beat-free period.

   The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the
   tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for
   the player. All tempo descriptors MUST be sorted in chronological
   order. The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as
   the beat description occurs. There may only be one "SYTC" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Synchronised tempo codes', ID: "SYTC">
     Time stamp format   $xx
     Tempo data          <binary data>

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.


4.8.   Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription

   This frame contains the lyrics of the song or a text transcription of
   other vocal activities. The head includes an encoding descriptor and
   a content descriptor. The body consists of the actual text. The
   'Content descriptor' is a terminated string. If no descriptor is
   entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only. Newline characters
   are allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Unsynchronised
   lyrics/text transcription' frame in each tag, but only one with the
   same language and content descriptor.

     <Header for 'Unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription', ID: "USLT">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     Content descriptor   <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Lyrics/text          <full text string according to encoding>


4.9.   Synchronised lyrics/text

   This is another way of incorporating the words, said or sung lyrics,
   in the audio file as text, this time, however, in sync with the
   audio. It might also be used to describing events e.g. occurring on a
   stage or on the screen in sync with the audio. The header includes a
   content descriptor, represented with as terminated text string. If no
   descriptor is entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only.

     <Header for 'Synchronised lyrics/text', ID: "SYLT">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     Time stamp format    $xx
     Content type         $xx
     Content descriptor   <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)

   Content type:   $00 is other
                   $01 is lyrics
                   $02 is text transcription
                   $03 is movement/part name (e.g. "Adagio")
                   $04 is events (e.g. "Don Quijote enters the stage")
                   $05 is chord (e.g. "Bb F Fsus")
                   $06 is trivia/'pop up' information
                   $07 is URLs to webpages
                   $08 is URLs to images

   Time stamp format:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG [MPEG] frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   Absolute time means that every stamp contains the time from the
   beginning of the file.

   The text that follows the frame header differs from that of the
   unsynchronised lyrics/text transcription in one major way. Each
   syllable (or whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by
   the encoder) is a null terminated string followed by a time stamp
   denoting where in the sound file it belongs. Each sync thus has the
   following structure:

     Terminated text to be synced (typically a syllable)
     Sync identifier (terminator to above string)   $00 (00)
     Time stamp                                     $xx (xx ...)

   The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if
   located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps
   should be sorted in chronological order. The sync can be considered
   as a validator of the subsequent string.

   Newline characters are allowed in all "SYLT" frames and MUST be used
   after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the content type
   $03 - $04.

   A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace
   separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus
   occurring in front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also
   valid for new line characters. A syllable followed by a comma should
   not be broken apart with a sync (both the syllable and the comma
   should be before the sync).

   An example: The "USLT" passage

     "Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"

   would be "SYLT" encoded as:

     "Strang" $00 xx xx "ers" $00 xx xx " in" $00 xx xx " the" $00 xx xx
     " night" $00 xx xx 0A "Ex" $00 xx xx "chang" $00 xx xx "ing" $00 xx
     xx "glan" $00 xx xx "ces" $00 xx xx

   There may be more than one "SYLT" frame in each tag, but only one
   with the same language and content descriptor.


4.10.   Comments

   This frame is intended for any kind of full text information that
   does not fit in any other frame. It consists of a frame header
   followed by encoding, language and content descriptors and is ended
   with the actual comment as a text string. Newline characters are
   allowed in the comment text string. There may be more than one
   comment frame in each tag, but only one with the same language and
   content descriptor.

     <Header for 'Comment', ID: "COMM">
     Text encoding          $xx
     Language               $xx xx xx
     Short content descrip. <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     The actual text        <full text string according to encoding>


4.11.   Relative volume adjustment (2)

   This is a more subjective frame than the previous ones. It allows the
   user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on each
   channel when the file is played. The purpose is to be able to align
   all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to change the
   volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance adjust the
   audio. The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel
   value, 16 bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving
   +/- 64 dB with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as
   $04 00 and -2 dB is $FC 00. There may be more than one "RVA2" frame
   in each tag, but only one with the same identification string.

     <Header for 'Relative volume adjustment (2)', ID: "RVA2">
     Identification          <text string> $00

   The 'identification' string is used to identify the situation and/or
   device where this adjustment should apply. The following is then
   repeated for every channel

     Type of channel         $xx
     Volume adjustment       $xx xx
     Bits representing peak  $xx
     Peak volume             $xx (xx ...)


   Type of channel:  $00  Other
                     $01  Master volume
                     $02  Front right
                     $03  Front left
                     $04  Back right
                     $05  Back left
                     $06  Front centre
                     $07  Back centre
                     $08  Subwoofer

   Bits representing peak can be any number between 0 and 255. 0 means
   that there is no peak volume field. The peak volume field is always
   padded to whole bytes, setting the most significant bits to zero.


4.12.   Equalisation (2)

   This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
   predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may be
   more than one "EQU2" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
   identification string.

     <Header of 'Equalisation (2)', ID: "EQU2">
     Interpolation method  $xx
     Identification        <text string> $00

   The 'interpolation method' describes which method is preferred when
   an interpolation between the adjustment point that follows. The
   following methods are currently defined:

     $00  Band
          No interpolation is made. A jump from one adjustment level to
          another occurs in the middle between two adjustment points.
     $01  Linear
          Interpolation between adjustment points is linear.

   The 'identification' string is used to identify the situation and/or
   device where this adjustment should apply. The following is then
   repeated for every adjustment point

     Frequency          $xx xx
     Volume adjustment  $xx xx

   The frequency is stored in units of 1/2 Hz, giving it a range from 0
   to 32767 Hz.

   The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel value, 16
   bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving +/- 64 dB
   with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as $04 00
   and -2 dB is $FC 00.

   Adjustment points should be ordered by frequency and one frequency
   should only be described once in the frame.


4.13.   Reverb

   Yet another subjective frame, with which you can adjust echoes of
   different kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce
   in ms. Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should
   be made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the
   amount of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00
   is 0%, $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
   reduction on the first bounce, 50% of that on the second and so on.
   Left to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the
   left speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to
   be played in the right speaker.

   'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the
   right before any reverb is applied, where $00 id 0% and $FF is 100%.
   'Premix right to left' does the same thing, but right to left.
   Setting both premix to $FF would result in a mono output (if the
   reverb is applied symmetric). There may only be one "RVRB" frame in
   each tag.

     <Header for 'Reverb', ID: "RVRB">
     Reverb left (ms)                 $xx xx
     Reverb right (ms)                $xx xx
     Reverb bounces, left             $xx
     Reverb bounces, right            $xx
     Reverb feedback, left to left    $xx
     Reverb feedback, left to right   $xx
     Reverb feedback, right to right  $xx
     Reverb feedback, right to left   $xx
     Premix left to right             $xx
     Premix right to left             $xx


4.14.   Attached picture

   This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
   Image format is the MIME type and subtype [MIME] for the image. In
   the event that the MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be
   implied. The "image/png" [PNG] or "image/jpeg" [JFIF] picture format
   should be used when interoperability is wanted. Description is a
   short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
   text string. There may be several pictures attached to one file, each
   in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the same content
   descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture type
   declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
   possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME
   type' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
   The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there
   is the risk of separation of files.

     <Header for 'Attached picture', ID: "APIC">
     Text encoding      $xx

                  $14  Publisher/Studio logotype


4.15.   General encapsulated object

   In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
   'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] represented as
   as a terminated string encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The
   filename is case sensitive and is encoded as 'Encoding'. Then follows
   a content description as terminated string, encoded as 'Encoding'.
   The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The first two
   strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations. MIME type is
   always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than one "GEOB"
   frame in each tag, but only one with the same content descriptor.

     <Header for 'General encapsulated object', ID: "GEOB">
     Text encoding          $xx

     Content description    <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Encapsulated object    <binary data>


4.16.   Play counter

   This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
   played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
   play. There may only be one "PCNT" frame in each tag. When the
   counter reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the
   counter thus making the counter eight bits bigger.  The counter must
   be at least 32-bits long to begin with.

     <Header for 'Play counter', ID: "PCNT">
     Counter        $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)


4.17.   Popularimeter

   The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
   Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
   playlist that features better audio files more often than others or
   it could be used to profile a person's taste and find other 'good'
   files by comparing people's profiles. The frame contains the email
   address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play counter,
   intended to be increased with one for every time the file is played.
   The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where 1 is
   worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is wanted
   it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all one's, one byte is
   inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter eight bits
   bigger in the same away as the play counter ("PCNT"). There may be
   more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
   email address.

     <Header for 'Popularimeter', ID: "POPM">
     Email to user   <text string> $00
     Rating          $xx
     Counter         $xx xx xx xx (xx ...)


4.18.   Recommended buffer size

   Sometimes the server from which an audio file is streamed is aware of
   transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
   audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
   recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
   flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
   maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audio
   stream. In such case the tag should reside between two MPEG [MPEG]
   frames, if the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next tag
   is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated
   from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of
   the header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are
   generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable
   behaviour from present software/hardware.

   For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed
   tags into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to
   individual connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin
   every transmission with a tag, then this tag should include a
   'recommended buffer size' frame. If the client is connected to a
   arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or multicast, then the
   'recommended buffer size' frame SHOULD be included in every tag.

   The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one
   "RBUF" frame in each tag.

     <Header for 'Recommended buffer size', ID: "RBUF">
     Buffer size               $xx xx xx
     Embedded info flag        %0000000x
     Offset to next tag        $xx xx xx xx


4.19.   Audio encryption

   This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
   whom. Since standardisation of such encryption scheme is beyond this
   document, all "AENC" frames begin with a terminated string with a
   URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
   email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
   responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
   regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
   specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the
   audio file indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered
   useless.

   After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the
   audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is
   described in frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should
   be left zeroed. After the 'preview length' field follows optionally a
   data block required for decryption of the audio. There may be more
   than one "AENC" frames in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner
   identifier'.

     <Header for 'Audio encryption', ID: "AENC">
     Owner identifier   <text string> $00
     Preview start      $xx xx
     Preview length     $xx xx
     Encryption info    <binary data>


4.20.   Linked information

   To keep information duplication as low as possible this frame may be
   used to link information from another ID3v2 tag that might reside in
   another audio file or alone in a binary file. It is RECOMMENDED that
   this method is only used when the files are stored on a CD-ROM or
   other circumstances when the risk of file separation is low. The
   frame contains a frame identifier, which is the frame that should be
   linked into this tag, a URL [URL] field, where a reference to the
   file where the frame is given, and additional ID data, if needed.
   Data should be retrieved from the first tag found in the file to
   which this link points. There may be more than one "LINK" frame in a
   tag, but only one with the same contents. A linked frame is to be
   considered as part of the tag and has the same restrictions as if it
   was a physical part of the tag (i.e. only one "RVRB" frame allowed,
   whether it's linked or not).

     <Header for 'Linked information', ID: "LINK">
     Frame identifier        $xx xx xx xx
     URL                     <text string> $00
     ID and additional data  <text string(s)>

   Frames that may be linked and need no additional data are "ASPI",
   "ETCO", "EQU2", "MCID", "MLLT", "OWNE", "RVA2", "RVRB", "SYTC", the
   text information frames and the URL link frames.

   The "AENC", "APIC", "GEOB" and "TXXX" frames may be linked with
   the content descriptor as additional ID data.

   The "USER" frame may be linked with the language field as additional
   ID data.
   
   The "PRIV" frame may be linked with the owner identifier as
   additional ID data.

   The "COMM", "SYLT" and "USLT" frames may be linked with three bytes
   of language descriptor directly followed by a content descriptor as
   additional ID data.


4.21.   Position synchronisation frame

   This frame delivers information to the listener of how far into the
   audio stream he picked up; in effect, it states the time offset from
   the first frame in the stream. The frame layout is:

     <Head for 'Position synchronisation', ID: "POSS">
     Time stamp format         $xx
     Position                  $xx (xx ...)

   Where time stamp format is:

     $01  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using MPEG frames as unit
     $02  Absolute time, 32 bit sized, using milliseconds as unit

   and position is where in the audio the listener starts to receive,
   i.e. the beginning of the next frame. If this frame is used in the
   beginning of a file the value is always 0. There may only be one
   "POSS" frame in each tag.


4.22.   Terms of use frame

   This frame contains a brief description of the terms of use and
   ownership of the file. More detailed information concerning the legal
   terms might be available through the "WCOP" frame. Newlines are
   allowed in the text. There may be more than one 'Terms of use' frame
   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Language'.

     <Header for 'Terms of use frame', ID: "USER">
     Text encoding        $xx
     Language             $xx xx xx
     The actual text      <text string according to encoding>


4.23.   Ownership frame

   The ownership frame might be used as a reminder of a made transaction
   or, if signed, as proof. Note that the "USER" and "TOWN" frames are
   good to use in conjunction with this one. The frame begins, after the
   frame ID, size and encoding fields, with a 'price paid' field. The
   first three characters of this field contains the currency used for
   the transaction, encoded according to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic
   currency code. Concatenated to this is the actual price paid, as a
   numerical string using "." as the decimal separator. Next is an 8
   character date string (YYYYMMDD) followed by a string with the name
   of the seller as the last field in the frame. There may only be one
   "OWNE" frame in a tag.

     <Header for 'Ownership frame', ID: "OWNE">
     Text encoding     $xx
     Price paid        <text string> $00
     Date of purch.    <text string>
     Seller            <text string according to encoding>


4.24.   Commercial frame

   This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by
   bundling all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex
   but it's an easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same
   result with several frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID,
   size and encoding fields, with a price string field. A price is
   constructed by one three character currency code, encoded according
   to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic currency code, followed by a
   numerical value where "." is used as decimal separator. In the price
   string several prices may be concatenated, separated by a "/"
   character, but there may only be one currency of each type.

   The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the
   format YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After
   that is a contact URL, with which the user can contact the seller,
   followed by a one byte 'received as' field. It describes how the
   audio is delivered when bought according to the following list:

        $00  Other
        $01  Standard CD album with other songs
        $02  Compressed audio on CD
        $03  File over the Internet
        $04  Stream over the Internet
        $05  As note sheets
        $06  As note sheets in a book with other sheets
        $07  Music on other media
        $08  Non-musical merchandise

   Next follows a terminated string with the name of the seller followed
   by a terminated string with a short description of the product. The
   last thing is the ability to include a company logotype. The first of
   them is the 'Picture MIME type' field containing information about
   which picture format is used. In the event that the MIME media type
   name is omitted, "image/" will be implied. Currently only "image/png"
   and "image/jpeg" are allowed. This format string is followed by the
   binary picture data. This two last fields may be omitted if no
   picture is attached. There may be more than one 'commercial frame' in
   a tag, but no two may be identical.

     <Header for 'Commercial frame', ID: "COMR">
     Text encoding      $xx
     Price string       <text string> $00
     Valid until        <text string>
     Contact URL        <text string> $00
     Received as        $xx
     Name of seller     <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Description        <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Picture MIME type  <string> $00
     Seller logo        <binary data>


4.25.   Encryption method registration

   To identify with which method a frame has been encrypted the
   encryption method must be registered in the tag with this frame. The
   'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for this specific encryption method. Questions regarding the
   encryption method should be sent to the indicated email address. The
   'Method symbol' contains a value that is associated with this method
   throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
   reserved. The 'Method symbol' may optionally be followed by
   encryption specific data. There may be several "ENCR" frames in a tag
   but only one containing the same symbol and only one containing the
   same owner identifier. The method must be used somewhere in the tag.
   See the description of the frame encryption flag in the ID3v2
   structure document [ID3v2-strct] for more information.

     <Header for 'Encryption method registration', ID: "ENCR">
     Owner identifier    <text string> $00
     Method symbol       $xx
     Encryption data     <binary data>


4.26.   Group identification registration

   This frame enables grouping of otherwise unrelated frames. This can
   be used when some frames are to be signed. To identify which frames
   belongs to a set of frames a group identifier must be registered in
   the tag with this frame. The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated
   string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a link to a
   location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
   organisation responsible for this grouping. Questions regarding the
   grouping should be sent to the indicated email address. The 'Group
   symbol' contains a value that associates the frame with this group
   throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
   reserved. The 'Group symbol' may optionally be followed by some group
   specific data, e.g. a digital signature. There may be several "GRID"
   frames in a tag but only one containing the same symbol and only one
   containing the same owner identifier. The group symbol must be used
   somewhere in the tag. See the description of the frame grouping flag
   in the ID3v2 structure document [ID3v2-strct] for more information.

     <Header for 'Group ID registration', ID: "GRID">
     Owner identifier      <text string> $00
     Group symbol          $xx
     Group dependent data  <binary data>


4.27.   Private frame

   This frame is used to contain information from a software producer
   that its program uses and does not fit into the other frames. The
   frame consists of an 'Owner identifier' string and the binary data.
   The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for the frame. Questions regarding the frame should be sent to the
   indicated email address. The tag may contain more than one "PRIV"
   frame but only with different contents.

     <Header for 'Private frame', ID: "PRIV">
     Owner identifier      <text string> $00
     The private data      <binary data>


4.28.   Signature frame

   This frame enables a group of frames, grouped with the 'Group
   identification registration', to be signed. Although signatures can
   reside inside the registration frame, it might be desired to store
   the signature elsewhere, e.g. in watermarks. There may be more than
   one 'signature frame' in a tag, but no two may be identical.

     <Header for 'Signature frame', ID: "SIGN">
     Group symbol      $xx
     Signature         <binary data>


4.29.   Seek frame

   This frame indicates where other tags in a file/stream can be found.
   The 'minimum offset to next tag' is calculated from the end of this
   tag to the beginning of the next. There may only be one 'seek frame'
   in a tag.

   <Header for 'Seek frame', ID: "SEEK">
   Minimum offset to next tag       $xx xx xx xx


4.30.   Audio seek point index

   Audio files with variable bit rates are intrinsically difficult to
   deal with in the case of seeking within the file. The ASPI frame
   makes seeking easier by providing a list a seek points within the
   audio file. The seek points are a fractional offset within the audio
   data, providing a starting point from which to find an appropriate
   point to start decoding. The presence of an ASPI frame requires the
   existence of a TLEN frame, indicating the duration of the file in
   milliseconds. There may only be one 'audio seek point index' frame in
   a tag.

     <Header for 'Seek Point Index', ID: "ASPI">
     Indexed data start (S)         $xx xx xx xx
     Indexed data length (L)        $xx xx xx xx
     Number of index points (N)     $xx xx
     Bits per index point (b)       $xx

   Then for every index point the following data is included;

     Fraction at index (Fi)          $xx (xx)

   'Indexed data start' is a byte offset from the beginning of the file.
   'Indexed data length' is the byte length of the audio data being
   indexed. 'Number of index points' is the number of index points, as
   the name implies. The recommended number is 100. 'Bits per index
   point' is 8 or 16, depending on the chosen precision. 8 bits works
   well for short files (less than 5 minutes of audio), while 16 bits is
   advantageous for long files. 'Fraction at index' is the numerator of
   the fraction representing a relative position in the data. The
   denominator is 2 to the power of b.

   Here are the algorithms to be used in the calculation. The known data
   must be the offset of the start of the indexed data (S), the offset
   of the end of the indexed data (E), the number of index points (N),
   the offset at index i (Oi). We calculate the fraction at index i
   (Fi).

   Oi is the offset of the frame whose start is soonest after the point
   for which the time offset is (i/N * duration).

   The frame data should be calculated as follows:

     Fi = Oi/L * 2^b    (rounded down to the nearest integer)

   Offset calculation should be calculated as follows from data in the
   frame:

     Oi = (Fi/2^b)*L    (rounded up to the nearest integer)

                    ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Changes

Status of this document

   This document describes the changes between ID3v2.3.0 [ID3v2.3.0] and
   ID3v2.4.0 [ID3v2.4.0-strct][ID3v2.4.0-frames]. This document does not
   claim to be complete nor correct. 

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.


Abstract

   This document outlines the more important differences between
   ID3v2.3.0 and ID3v2.4.0. In general ID3v.2.4.0 can be said to be more
   consistent and easier to implement and more suitable to real world
   conditions than the previous versions.

2.   Conventions in this document

   References to sections in the ID3v2.4.0 Main Structure
   [ID3v2.4.0-strct] document will be given as [S:x.y] where x is the
   section and y is the subsection. In a similar fashion references to
   sections in the ID3v2.4.0 Native Frames [ID3v2.4.0-frames] document
   will be given as [F:x.y].


3.   Tag structure changes

   The location of tags in a file as well as methods to find and merge
   tags are far better defined in ID3v2.4.0 [S:5] than previous
   versions. A reverse search for tags are improved by the addition of a
   tag footer [S:3.4]. A tag footer flag has been added to the header
   flags to indicate the presence of a ID3v2 footer, hence the size
   field is not affected by the footer [S:3.1].

   The extended header has been completely rewritten [S:3.2] and can not
   produce false synchs. It is also possible to indicate artificial tag
   restrictions in the extended header, for use with thinner clients.
   
   Unsynchronisation [S:6.1] is done on frame level, instead of on tag
   level, making it easier to skip frames, increasing the streamability
   of the tag. The unsynchronisation flag in the header [S:3.1]
   indicates if all frames has been unsynchronized, while the new
   unsynchronisation flag in the frame header [S:4.1.2] indicates
   unsynchronisation. To avoid false synchronisations in the frame
   header the size description and flag field has been rewritten [S:4].
   Resynchronisation of the complete tag when the unsynchronisation flag
